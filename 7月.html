Home, Home on the Ranch
Young students from many nations travel to Canada each
summer for the vacation of a lifetime. Those who take part
will spend their days living and working like the cowboys
of long ago at a working ranch in northern Alberta,
Canada.
It will make an unforgettable summer. They’ll learn about
co-operation and hard work. Imagine twenty students from
ten different nations living together in a ranch bunkhouse
that was once used by the cowboys of the Wild West!
Horses, cows, wide open spaces, big night skies and
living the way people did in Canada more than 100 years
ago.
Soon after arriving in early July, the teenagers will learn
how to ride a horse. After that, they’ll learn how to chop
wood, make a fire, and cook a noon-time meal out in the
open fields. They’ll learn how to find their way using a
compass, the sun, the moon and the stars as their guide.
Building fences, chopping hay -- the list of skills goes on
and on. But the main skill these young international
students will pick up is the skill of getting along with
others.
They’ll rise each morning with the sun, eat a huge
breakfast, saddle their horses and ride out to the ranch for
a day of cattle herding. They’ll come back just before
sundown, and work another hour around the camp and
the kitchen. When their long day of labour is complete,
they’ll finally sit down together for a meal.
Later in the evening, around a big campfire, they’ll discuss
world issues. They’ll think about ways that they, as
teenagers, can make a difference. Not long after the stars
come out, they’ll be fast asleep in their bunks.
Russian, Chinese, English, Spanish -- one of the first
things they’ll do is to learn how to communicate with each
other.
By the end of their stay at this dude ranch, they’ll know a
lot about each other. They’ll understand their different
cultures and what it is that makes them tick. Many of the
friendships made at this ranch will last a lifetime. When the
students return to their home countries, they’ll have a
better understanding of the way other people live.

The Ghost of Summer Camp
Every year I go to a girls’ camp for two weeks during the
summer holidays. This year, I went to a camp that was
right across from another girls’ camp.
One night, we did something that we should not have
done. We made a plan with four girls from the other camp.
We would wait until everyone was asleep, borrow a canoe
and meet on a little island with an old shack on it. The
shack was supposed to be haunted. We thought it would
be exciting. But we didn’t know just how exciting our
evening would turn out to be.
We made it to the island and waited for the other girls.
There was no sign of them. We waited in the old shack for
about ten minutes. Those ten minutes seemed like hours.
Every strange sound made us jump.
Then, we heard a person whispering and saw a strange
light coming towards the shack. It was green and it looked
very spooky in the mist!
We all screamed and ran to the water. We jumped in the
canoe and never looked back. We didn’t stop paddling
until we got to our camp, which was about a mile away.
The next night, we met with the girls from the other camp.
We asked them if it was they who had frightened us.
“We never left the camp,” they told us. “One of the adults
caught us.”
Suddenly, we heard a whisper coming from the forest and
then we saw the strange green light again. Had it followed
us here?
Then, our camp leader Jessica appeared. “Hi girls,” she
said, smiling. “Remember me? I followed you out to the
island last night to keep an eye on you. When I saw you
sneaking away, I figured I should teach you a lesson.”
Then, she put the green flashlight under her chin to make
a scary face and said with a smile, “If you go out in one of
those canoes at night again, it won’t be ghosts you’ll have
to worry about! Understand?”
From that moment on, we were the best-behaved kids at
camp!

New Land, New Home
Joe immigrated to Canada at the age of 41. There were
many stressful days as he had his whole family to take
care of. He rented an apartment and bought a few pieces
of furniture and some cookware.
Since he had no job, the savings they brought with them
were diminishing rapidly. They needed to buy groceries
and pay the rent. After getting his family settled, Joe went
out to look for a job.
As he walked, he saw many things on the street that
people threw away on garbage day -- TVs, washers,
furniture and refrigerators. Joe could not believe his eyes.
“Why would people get rid of such things?” he asked
himself. Seeing all the “junk”, Joe decided to take the
television home to see what the problem was. After all, he
was an electrician before he came to Canada.
Since he was twelve years old, Joe’s main hobby has
been electronics. He assembled a radio back in the
1970s, which was quite something for a teenage boy.
Now, he had no job and no income. All he had was time
and his hobby. He plugged the television into a wall plug.
There were images on the screen, but there was no
sound. He opened the back cover using the tools he’d
brought with him. Before long, Joe diagnosed the problem.
The loudspeaker was broken.
He went out again. And there was garbage placed on the
sidewalk waiting to be picked up in the morning. He found
a toy keyboard. He was delighted and carried the
keyboard home. The keyboard didn’t work, but luckily its
loudspeaker did. Fifteen minutes later, Joe had a TV with
both picture and sound.
Joe began to question people why they threw away so
many electronics. The answer was the same from
everyone: repair services were too expensive. He
discovered that people would rather buy new products.
Joe made up his mind to open an electronics repair shop
that would offer fair prices.
Today, Joe has much success in his new country. He
could have lost hope. Instead, he chose to make the best
out of a tough situation.

Terrifying Lizards: Rulers of Their Day
They’ve been extinct for more than 65 million years. They
left no pictures or libraries filled with books. Yet, they live
on in the imaginations of people of every age and
nationality.
Mention the word “dinosaur” to anyone and you’re bound
to have something to talk about.
We have known about these strange creatures for less
than 200 years. Their fossil record was first discovered in
1818. The word “dinosaur” was coined in 1842 by a
scientist who put two Greek words together -- deinos,
which means “frightening thing”, and sauros which means
“lizard”.
They were large reptiles that roamed the earth in
prehistoric times. Of all the creatures living in that era,
dinosaurs were the most numerous. They were feared by
all the other life forms. And for almost 200 million years,
before their quick and mysterious disappearance from the
earth, dinosaurs ruled this planet.
What we know about dinosaurs comes only through the
fossil record they left behind. We can get an idea of how
they looked by reconstructing their skeletons using
fossilized bones and teeth. We have a pretty good picture
of their size and structure, but not much else is known for
certain.
We do know that they lived on land and walked erectly.
They must have been impressive as they towered high
above the other creatures of their time. Some walked on
two legs. Others preferred four legs. Some were fast and
others were quite slow.
Remember, we are working only with the bones they left
behind when we study dinosaurs. This limits us in what we
can really know about them. For example, what colour
were they? Nobody knows. Did they roar like lions, or
were their voices sweet and musical like birds? Again,
how can we know? The fossil record does not speak.
Keep in mind that what we don’t know about dinosaurs is
far greater than what we do know about them. As with a
lot of research about prehistoric times, scientists often
have to read between the lines.

A Special Prescription (I)
I always thought of myself as having a “rubber stomach”. I
can put anything in it, and it will digest without giving me
any trouble. In fact, I don’t remember having an upset
stomach since I was five years old. However, all of this
changed one summer day after a meal in a seafood
restaurant.
It was 3 o’clock in the morning when my dreams were
interrupted by an aching pain in my stomach. It felt as
though a fork was in there, turning and spinning. I dashed
out of bed and headed straight for the washroom. A few
minutes later, I stumbled back to bed, but before I was
able to fall asleep again, another jolt of pain hit. I ran to
the washroom again. This happened again and again. It
was like that all night. By 6 o’clock in the morning, I could
barely stand up. I decided I’d better head to the hospital.
The doctor at the emergency room was a young lady. She
took a good look at me as I sat in agony. Then, she started
pressing down on different spots of my stomach. As she
pressed, she asked if I felt any pain. I did, but I wasn’t
sure where the pain was. She asked me to take some
blood tests. Fifteen minutes later, she got the test results.
My blood tests indicated that I had an infection.
“It could be an intestinal infection, or it could be
appendicitis,” explained the doctor. “Let’s hope it’s an
intestinal infection. If it’s appendicitis, we will have to do a
surgery immediately. Take these four bottles of
intravenous drip, and see if you feel better tomorrow.”
After lying in a hospital bed for half a day, I finished four
bottles of antibiotics. I went home hoping to get better
soon, but I was not feeling any better. I hadn’t eaten
anything for a full day. And I couldn’t even fall asleep
anymore.
Not only did I still feel very weak, but my arms and legs
began to hurt as well. In fact, I even started having trouble
breathing.
Deeply disappointed at the diagnosis from the first
hospital, I decided to go to another hospital for a re-
examination.
7-6
A Special Prescription (II)
This time, I visited a different hospital to see another
expert. After hearing my symptoms, both new and old, he
gave me a check up. He came up with an entirely new
diagnosis.
“It could be food poisoning or you may have a problem
with your heart,” said the doctor. “Your breathing is now a
new problem. I suggest you take an electrocardiograph.
Let’s hope it’s not your heart.”
I was in shock at how a bad dinner had now turned into
heart disease. I still had diarrhea. On top of that, now my
arms and legs were in pain and I was short of breath. My
whole world was crashing down.
I took the cardiograph, and the results were good. Why
had everything all of sudden gone wrong? The doctor had
no clue. He suggested that I continue taking the
antibiotics. I hesitated to do so because new problems
were appearing one after another. What should I do?
I suddenly remembered that my aunt’s friend was a doctor.
I called my aunt, and she suggested that I see her doctor
friend. Like the previous two, Doctor Dean asked about
my symptoms. To my surprise, he didn’t do any further
testing. He gave his diagnosis right away.
“You’re fine. You just went to the bathroom too many
times. You lost too much salt, and your body is out of
balance. That’s why your muscles are becoming weak.
That’s why you are short of breath, and that’s why your
arms and legs are sore. Go home and have some noodle
soup,” he advised. “You’ll be all right tomorrow morning.”
After all I had been through with the two other doctors, you
can understand why I doubted this special prescription.
But I decided to try it out.
That evening, after having an entire pot of noodle soup, I
went to bed hoping for the best but expecting the worst.
When I woke up, just as Doctor Dean had predicted, I was
entirely healthy again! I shook my arms and legs, I walked
back and forth, and I jumped up and down. No problems.
All my discomfort had disappeared!
It is really amazing what a good pot of noodle soup can
do.

Christmas in July
Sometimes, when something happens, you know what the
right thing to do is. And when you do it, you always feel
good about it. Let me tell you what happened to me, and
you’ll see what I mean.
One year, my parents and I were on vacation in southern
Mexico. We took a day trip by sea canoe on the deep
green ocean. I was hanging over the edge of my canoe,
admiring the coral and the shells. We were about to head
in for the day, when my eye caught something that was
bright silver and sparkling.
It was a diamond ring! It looked like an engagement ring.
I thought it must be worth thousands of dollars, and the
owner must be very anxious to find it. When I got to shore,
I took the ring to the hotel where I was staying. I told the
manager that I found it in the water off the beach. He told
me that he would send out a message that a ring had
been found.
That evening, while I was eating dinner with my family, we
all suddenly heard a woman screaming in the hotel
restaurant. She had just got her ring back! I saw her
standing with a young man and the hotel manager. The
manager pointed at me, and the couple quickly came over
and introduced themselves.
That morning, the woman had been swimming with the
ring on her finger and had lost it. They paid for my dinner
and we had a great time that night celebrating our good
luck.
The next day when we checked out of the hotel, the entire
bill had been paid by the young couple. You know, I have
to admit that when I first saw that ring, I thought of keeping
it or selling it.
But it didn’t take me long to realize that the only thing to
do was to find out who the owner was. When I saw the
joyous look on that woman’s face after she got her ring
back, I was so glad that I had done the right thing.
It was like Christmas in July for both of us.

Canada’s National Animal Symbol
Symbols are shortcuts. Advertising and marketing people
love them because of their simplicity and power.
Most nations adopt symbols to represent certain aspects
of their country. A national flag is, of course, the most
easily recognized symbol for a country. However, animals,
flowers, significant landmarks and even historic buildings
or structures can serve as country symbols too.
In 1975, Canada declared the beaver a symbol of the
sovereignty of Canada. There are numerous reasons for
this choice. The most significant one is that Canada’s
early history and development is closely tied to this hard-
working little animal.
When the first European explorers arrived on Canada’s
shores, they soon learned that the native people living
there hunted and trapped beavers as a primary source of
food, leather and fur for clothing.
The first Europeans took some shiny beaver pelts (or
processed beaver fur) back to Europe where the rich
people quickly fell in love with a new kind of hat that was
being manufactured using beaver pelts.
Soon, all over Europe, everyone wanted one of these
fashionable beaver hats. An explosion of discovery
occurred as the Europeans made alliances with the
various indigenous nations in Canada. They began to
travel deep into the Canadian wilderness in search of
beaver pelts. Great fur trading posts were established
thousands of kilometres deep into the unknown parts of
Canada. Battles were fought over the rights to trade
beaver pelts in Canada’s early years.
Within two hundred years, almost all of the beavers had
been wiped out because of this excessive trading of
beaver pelts. But, beavers have one trait that Canadians
found appealing -- the beaver does not give up easily.
They are hardy and strong, hard-working and tireless.
These are the traits that allowed beavers to make an
incredible comeback.
There are many reasons for Canada’s love affair with the
beaver. The enduring characteristics of loyalty, hard work
and honesty are all high on that list, making the beaver a
natural choice for a national symbol, and an icon for
Canadians everywhere.

Strange Ball of Lightning
Science is all about explaining. There are, however, some
things -- like lightning balls -- that science cannot explain.
One summer, five years ago, I experienced a ball of
lightning. It was frightening and strange, and it forever
changed the way I felt during a thunderstorm.
I was sitting in my kitchen, watching the end of a large
thunderstorm. The day was quieting after the storm. The
rain had stopped, and it was beginning to clear up.
Suddenly, a loud crack rang out. There was a loud
explosion at the ground below the kitchen window. Without
warning, a ball of what seemed like fire or electricity
entered my home and moved in a slow, steady pattern,
directly towards me as I sat in my chair.
I was frozen, unable to move. I watched the ball of
lightning heading straight for my face. It was about the
size of a soccer ball. It was extremely colourful and
seemed to have little hairs of fire sprouting out all over its
surface. The ball of lightning was about three feet off the
floor. It moved slowly and steadily and did not waver up or
down. I could feel the hair on my head standing up.
Goosebumps formed on my skin as I sat there watching it.
Just as the lightning ball was about to make contact with
my face, I reached out with my finger to touch the ball. My
feeling was that it was better to do that than to let the ball
hit me directly in the face.
As soon as my finger made contact with the ball of fire,
there was a loud POP and then it was gone.
The room was entirely silent and there was a strong smell
of sulphur in the air. It all happened in a matter of
seconds, but it left me with a strong memory. Never again
have I been able to rest easily during or right after a
thunderstorm.
Weather might be predictable most of the time, but there
are still a few unexplained weather mysteries. Lightning
balls are just one of these strange weather events. If you
ever encounter one, at least you have been forewarned.

How the Honeybee Got Its Stinger
(based on a traditional Greek legend)
My grandmother moved to Canada from Greece when she
was a young girl. I love to spend time with her, especially
in the summer. Why? She has great gardens, and I love to
hear the stories she tells about the creatures in her
gardens.
There are butterflies, birds, dragonflies, and all types of
insects flying through her flowers and vegetables. As we
sat and smelled the gorgeous scents, Grandma told me
about how the little honeybee got its powerful stinger.
As the legend goes, one of the Greek gods, Zeus, was
feeling generous. He invited all the animals of his world to
come and see him. He was going to give each of them a
gift -- anything they might ask for.
Birds asked for beautiful feathers and sweet songs to sing.
Insects had requests of all kinds.
But the strangest request came from the honeybee. When
the little bee flew up to greet Zeus, he startled the god with
a strange request.
“I know you will give me any gift that I may desire,” began
the honeybee. “I have only one request. Please give me
the power to hurt whomever I choose.”
Zeus was taken aback by this strange request. But he
agreed to grant the wish since he was feeling generous. “I
will give you a stinger,” said Zeus. “When you sting
someone with it, it will cause unbearable pain.”
The honeybee was very pleased. “Thank you, Zeus,” he
said. “I am happy that you are giving me this weapon.”
Zeus then added, “There is one more thing. I know that
you are a kind and gentle insect, and that you will use this
stinger with great care. You must never use it in anger or
hate. Just to be certain, I have made it so that you can use
it only once. Using this stinger will cause you to lose your
life. Do you understand?”
“And that,” explained my grandmother, “is why even today
the honeybee dies after it stings someone.”

Joseph, the Jumper
Lots of kids tried out for our school volleyball team. Most
were very tall. Some were over six feet tall. At one point
during the tryouts, the gym door opened and in walked a
small boy named Joseph. He was barely five feet tall.
There was a giggle when he asked, “Is this the volleyball
tryout?”
We did some drills. He wasn’t bad at bumping the ball and
passing it, but not good enough to make the team. The
coach took him aside and told him so. Then, this small boy
said, “I’m not the best at bumping the ball. I’m a hitter.”
A hitter or spiker in volleyball is the person who jumps way
up towards the net and hits the ball down on the other
side. They are always tall.
The coach looked skeptically at the short kid standing right
in front of him. The rest of us were trying to keep from
laughing.
“No, I’m serious!” the kid said. So the coach took a ball
and said, “Okay, come here.” The coach stood by the net
and set the ball into the air. Joseph came running in, and
what we saw next was incredible. He seemed to be able
to fly! He jumped so high that even with his small size, he
was able to hit the ball down.
Everyone was amazed. Of course, he made the team.
When we played our first game, the other team was
laughing at Joseph. That made us mad, so on the very
first play I set to Joseph and he smashed the ball down on
the other side. They didn’t laugh anymore.
Joseph is the star of our team, and he’s a great guy. One
time, I said to Joseph, “Imagine how high you could jump
if you were really tall!” Joseph said, “If I were really tall I
would have never learned to jump.”
That made me think... Sometimes, something we believe
is a problem is actually an advantage.

My Big Camping Trip
When I was a kid, I always wanted to go camping. I was
thirteen when my brother, who was twenty, finally gave in
and took me on a camping trip.
We decided to take a bus to a nearby town that had a hill
and a deep ravine in its outskirts. Once we got there, we’d
find a place to set up our tent and spend the night.
It seemed simple.
My parents took us to the bus station on Saturday
morning. We got on the bus and took off. Halfway to the
city, my head began to ache and I got an upset stomach.
And it just got worse and worse. Finally, I couldn’t stand it
any longer. My brother and I got off the bus.
There we were, in the middle of nowhere, stranded. No
one knew how we were going to get home. We started
walking.
I asked my brother many times how long we had to walk.
“Not very long,” he told me. He was right. Half an hour
later, we came to a little town. Luckily, it had a train station,
so we bought two train tickets.
Just then, a big helicopter appeared above us, and then,
another. They hovered over the train station and then, one
moved ahead and the other stayed above the station.
About a minute later, we saw that a train was coming.
Two police officers told us to move back from the tracks.
The train didn’t stop, but it slowed. It was only three cars
long. As it passed, other people on the platform waved at
the people on board. We did too, although we didn’t know
why.
When the last car passed, we saw a woman standing on
the back balcony of the car. She waved and smiled at us.
We waved back. It was then that I realized I was waving at
the Queen of England, who was visiting our country.
We set out on our camping adventure and had a
wonderful trip. If I hadn’t been sick on the bus, we would
never have “met” the Queen of England! She would never
have met us either.

Sweet Corn
Uncle Russ loves sweet corn. Once, he said to me, “Do
you know what we, as Canadians, are proud of?” Before I
could answer, he said, “Sweet com.” I knew he was
exaggerating, but that shows just how much he loves
sweet corn.
Each year, Uncle Russ has a picnic party. Sweet com is
one of the main foods he serves to his guests. One of the
reasons, he says, is because one year, his cousins came
to visit from France. They asked specifically for sweet corn
during their stay in Ottawa, and they never tired of it.
One evening, we got a call from Uncle Russ. “Come over
quick!” he exclaimed. “I have something special.” It turned
out that my uncle had just returned from Toronto. On the
way home, he saw a farmer selling sweet corn on the road
beside a cornfield. He pulled over and bought five dozen
cobs of sweet corn -- filling nearly half of his trunk.
While the sweet corn was cooking, he said, “Do you know
that sweet corn, when it’s freshly picked from the garden,
is far tastier than the corn sold in big grocery stores?”
“Why?” I asked.
“It’s because the sugar in sweet corn quickly turns to
starch, giving it a dull flavour after only a day or so. You’ll
see what I mean,” he said as he collected the corn from
the pot.
“Wow!” my brother said. “It’s really sweet!”
“And tasty,” I agreed. “And it’s also very nutritious,” my
uncle added. “Each cob provides roughly 22 percent of the
daily requirements of vitamins A and C, magnesium and
iron.”
As we enjoyed feasting on sweet com, my uncle explained
that not many countries can grow it. When it’s used as a
fresh crop, it must be refrigerated immediately and moved
to market quickly in order to retain its sweet quality.
Because of this, very little fresh sweet corn is exported to
other countries.
“Oh, Canada! Oh, sweet corn. Our home and native land,”
my uncle sang, half-joking. He wishes more of the world
could taste some freshly harvested Canadian sweet corn.
Yes, Uncle Russ loves sweet corn.

A Moving Waterfall
I live in a city called Niagara Falls. It’s in Canada. The city
is named after the massive waterfall on the Niagara River
between Canada and the United States.
There are two sections. One is called the American Falls.
And the other larger section, which is on the Canadian
side of the border, is called the Horseshoe Falls because it
forms a U-shape, just like the shoes nailed to horses’
hooves.
At 53 metres tall, they are not the tallest in the world, but
they are about one kilometre wide. So much water goes
over the falls that you could fill 13,000 bathtubs per
second!
The Horseshoe Falls is beautiful. Every year, more than
20 million people come from all over the world to enjoy
this beauty.
Now, here is the interesting thing about the falls: they have
moved back 11 kilometres since they were formed. You’re
probably wondering how waterfalls can move. You see,
the rushing water causes the rocks on the edge to wear
away and fall over the edge. Over many thousands of
years, the falls have moved back in this way. Today,
engineers have made the falls stronger with metal and
concrete so that the rushing water does not wear down
the rock as easily.
The word Niagara comes from the Niagagarega people.
They lived in the area hundreds of years before the
Europeans discovered the falls around the year 1600.
Believe it or not, about fourteen people have gone over
the falls on purpose. These people are known as stunt
people. They do dangerous things just to get noticed. In
1901, a 63-year-old school teacher was the first person to
go over the falls in a barrel! She survived.
Since then, other people have gone over the falls in
barrels. Nowadays, it is illegal to try such stunts at Niagara
Falls. But in the old days, people did it all the time. Some
even strung tightropes high above the falls and walked
across!

The King and a Wise Judgement
(adapted from a Bible story)
Wisdom is a wonderful thing.
Long ago, a king named Solomon asked his God to make
him wise so that he could help his people. God saw that
the king was good because he asked not for riches and
power for himself but only for the wisdom to make good
decisions for his people.
One day, two women from the kingdom came to see the
king. They had a small baby with them and were fighting
over whose baby it was.
The two women lived in the same house, and they each
had a child. But during the night, one woman rolled over
on her baby and crushed it. The baby died. This woman
snuck over to the other woman’s bed, stole her baby, and
took it to her side as if it were her own.
When the other woman awoke, she shouted, “Where is
my baby? You have stolen my baby!” The woman whose
child was dead said, “No, this is my baby. Your baby is the
one that is dead.”
There was no way to settle this problem, so the two
women went to King Solomon and asked for his
judgement.
The king was wise. He thought for a minute and then
called for his sword. “Put the baby on this table,” he
commanded. “Since you cannot agree who is the mother
of this child, I shall cut it in two pieces and each of you
shall have one half.” He raised his sword above the baby,
but as he was about to cut, one woman (the rightful
mother) cried, “No, no! Please. Do not kill my baby. I will
let her have it. It is mine, but it’s better that she has it so
that it can live.”
The king put down his sword and turned to this woman.
He gave her the child and said, “You are the real mother of
this child. Take it, and go.”
Such was the wisdom of the great king. And wisdom is
indeed a wonderful thing.

One Insect, Four Lives
Nature is amazing! Take a close look at the world of
insects and you will discover many unbelievable things.
Consider butterflies, for example. They have beautiful,
colourful wings, and strong, steady flying skills. On
summer days, we see them flying gracefully over flower
gardens and wild fields.
But, did you know that butterflies live three separate lives
before they become the flying insects we all know?
They begin their lives as one thing, change into another,
and then another. Finally, they emerge as beautiful flying
insects. It’s true. And it’s one of the amazing wonders of
nature.
In the beginning, there is an egg. It’s usually small and
colourful. Female butterflies lay an egg on a leaf or stem
of a plant. When you look at this tiny egg, it’s hard to
believe that in a few days, it will become something
completely different.
In time, it emerges into a new life. No longer small and
immobile, the egg becomes a walking insect. This insect is
called a caterpillar. It now has legs, eyes, a mouth and a
large body. A new life has begun. The caterpillar eats, and
eats, and eats. It can walk. It can see. But it is still not a
butterfly. Soon, after growing big, the caterpillar makes a
cover for itself. It wraps itself in this nice protective blanket
and goes to sleep. This stage of a butterfly’s life is known
as the “pupa” stage.
What happens next is truly amazing!
After a period of time, the blanket breaks and a wet, weak
butterfly appears. It now has six legs, a mouth, eyes and
wings. Soon, the wings fill with blood, and the beautiful,
colourful butterfly spreads its wings and flies away.
After a few weeks pass, this adult butterfly lays her eggs,
and the cycle begins all over again.
This is just one example of the wonders of nature. Look
around the natural world, and you will learn many truly
amazing things.

The Orange Tree
(based on a traditional legend from Haiti)
Long ago, a child’s mother died giving birth to her little girl,
leaving the father all alone with the baby. He decided to
take a new wife. Unluckily for the girl, the new wife did not
accept the young child.
As the girl grew up, the stepmother treated her badly.
The girl was not given much food to eat and was always
hungry. One day, she came into the house to find three
orange fruits on the table. No one had ever seen fruits
such as these. The girl, being starved, ate one of the
oranges. It was good, so she ate another, and then
another.
The stepmother came home to find the special orange
fruits gone. “Someone will pay for this!” she shrieked. “I
will beat this person and make her suffer.”
The young girl ran away to her birth mother’s grave. She
was frightened. She prayed to her mother to help her. She
finally cried herself to sleep.
Unknown to her, a seed from the strange orange fruit fell
from her apron. A beautiful tree grew in the night. When
the girl awoke, she discovered a tree filled with the
wonderful orange fruits. But it had grown too tall. The girl
asked the tree to get smaller, and it did, allowing her to
pick the fruits and return home.
Her stepmother saw the beautiful fruits, took them from
the girl, and ate them all. She ordered the girl to show her
this special tree. When they arrived, it had grown again,
stretching all the way to the clouds. The stepmother
jumped into the tree and began to climb, pulling the fruits
off and eating them as she climbed. The girl was afraid.
She told the tree to keep growing. It rose all the way to the
sky, then cracked and broke, sending the stepmother to
her death.
The girl asked the tree to come back to earth. It did as she
requested, returning to the size of a normal fruit tree. She
picked some of the sweet fruits and took them to the
market.
From that day on, she never worried about food or her evil
stepmother again.

A Swimming Star
Our school was having a swimming competition. It’s not a
serious race, just a fun activity between classes. Each
class selects four of its best swimmers to compete.
There are six Grade 8 classes in our school. Each class
wanted to be the best. After a hot debate, our class
selected three competitors. The last selection was difficult
as not everyone was able to swim the required style.
Then, a boy who came from a rural area spoke up. “I
could be the fourth one,” he said. “But I learned to swim in
a river, not a swimming pool.”
It didn’t matter, as long as he could swim. He was selected
as the fourth member of our team.
The 4x100 swim relay was about to begin. Of course, this
relay had four different styles of swimming.
A teacher called out, “Ready. Set. Go!”
As the teacher fired the gun, six people -- one from each
team -- shot into the pool. They swam quickly. We all
cheered from the side. Our team wasn’t good. We
gradually fell behind the others, especially the best team,
which was in the lane next to ours.
Finally, our last person jumped in. We didn’t expect much
from him. The last leg was the backstroke, and the leading
team was way ahead of us. Their last swimmer was so
fast that he had already touched the wall of the swimming
pool and was heading towards the finish line.
At the halfway point, he met our last swimmer, who was
swimming in the other direction. He didn’t swim like the
others at all. He just kept his face up and used his two
legs to push himself forward. He had no sense of
direction. When the two got close to each other, our
swimmer swam into the other’s lane and collided with him.
The two accidentally switched lanes!
A few seconds later, the swimmer from the best team
reached the finish line, but he finished in our lane. Our
team won!
We all laughed until our stomachs hurt. What a funny way
to win!

Electricity: A Natural Force
It’s there, but it has no weight, no colour, and you can’t
smell it. You can’t see it, but it’s working everywhere in our
modern world. Don’t try to touch it! It’s dangerous. It has
always existed, but humans learned about it only 500
years ago.
What is it? Electricity. It’s powerful and mysterious. Thanks
to electricity, you can flick a switch and have light.
Watched a good TV show lately? You couldn’t do that
without electricity. We cook our food, heat our homes and
run our computers using electricity. But what is it, really?
Here is a simple description. Everything in the world is
made of atoms. Atoms are small. You can fit millions of
them on the head of a pin. In every atom, there are
electrons, protons and neutrons. In some atoms, it is
possible to move electrons easily from one atom to
another. As the electrons move, a current is created. This
is electricity.
Don’t worry if you don’t understand it fully. Just remember
that electricity is the result of the movement of electrons.
As the electrons move, they create a strong electric
charge.
There are many ways to generate electricity. A machine
called a generator spins rapidly. Water and wind can make
a generator spin. So can motors fuelled by oil. As the
generator spins, the electrons begin to move. As they
move, they create an electric current. Power lines are built
from generators to carry this current to places where
people can use it. Along your street, power lines bring
electricity right to your door. A wire runs into your house.
More wires inside your house are attached to the plugs.
Plug in your lamp, the electricity lights up the bulb, and
you have light!
It takes a lot of energy to make electricity. Oil is one of the
main fuels used to power electric generators. Another
common fuel is coal. Our planet is running out of these
resources, and using them creates a lot of pollution.
In the future, most electricity will be produced using the
sun and wind. But for now, be careful about how much
electricity you use. Don’t forget to turn off the lights when
you leave a room. Every little bit helps.

Mother’s Day
There was this boy whose mother died while she was
giving birth to him. Every year, as Mother’s Day
approached, he would be overcome with sadness. He
missed his mom so much. He would ask himself, “Why
don’t I have a mother? Why do I miss my mom even
though I never met her?”
Then one Mother’s Day, while all the other children were
celebrating this day with their mothers, the boy walked
along a road and wept sadly. Suddenly, an old woman
stopped him.
She asked him what was wrong. The boy said that it was
the saddest day in the year because it always made him
think about the mother who he never met.
He didn’t have a mother to grow up with. Instead, he lived
with his grandparents.
The old woman listened to him carefully. After a while, she
said, “You may not have a mother. Yes, that is true. But
I don’t either and I always celebrate Mother’s Day. Don’t
forget, young boy, Mother’s Day is the day we remember
ALL mothers everywhere. Not just mothers here in our
own land, but mothers all over the world. We honour the
many things they do for us.”
The old woman stopped talking for a moment and
watched a mother and her small children passing on the
road. “Look at that young mother with her two kids,” said
the old woman. “She has to carry those two kids and her
groceries all the way home. She does it out of love for her
family. And don’t forget that a grandmother is also a
mother.”
“Yes, that’s true,” nodded the young boy. The old woman
continued, “On Mother’s Day, I say Happy Mother’s
Day to every woman I meet.”
The young boy opened his eyes wide, listening attentively.
He began to realize this was a wonderful way to look at
Mother’s Day.

A Disagreement
(based on a traditional Chinese tale)
I had an argument with my brother today. It was a stupid
argument about who should be allowed to play with a new
game. We could not agree, so we asked our mother to
settle the dispute. She listened to both of us, considered
our points of view, and then told us an interesting story.
Long ago, two hunters went to the woods to hunt for food
for their village. They spotted a goose flying low in the sky.
It was going to be an easy shot. The two hunters loaded
their bows with arrows and prepared to shoot the goose.
One of the hunters remarked that the goose would make a
tasty stew. The other hunter disagreed. “A stew is good,”
he said. “But this goose will taste better if we roast it over
a fire.” An argument followed, with each hunter insisting on
his point of view.
“We will cook it in a stew,” insisted one. “No, we will roast
it over a fire,” said the other. As they could not agree, they
decided to ask a village elder what to do.
At the village, the elder listened to both sides, and then
came to his decision. “Most easy,” he said, smiling. “Half
will be stewed, and half will be roasted. This is the only
way to make you both happy.”
The hunters were very happy with this decision. They
quickly returned to where they had spotted the goose. Of
course, the goose had long since disappeared.
Instead of feasting on a cooked goose that evening, the
two hunters were hungry. If they had agreed to get the
goose first and then decide what to do with it, they would
have gone to bed with full bellies that night.
When Mom told my brother and me this story, we
immediately understood what it meant. Sometimes it’s
better to settle an argument right away. Waiting to settle it
later can lead to undesirable results.

The Gift of Independence
Thirteen-year-old Susan Jones often noticed blind people
walking with guide dogs in her busy city. It always amazed
her to see the dogs work. How did they do it? How did
they know the traffic lights? How did they concentrate in
busy city traffic? These were questions that always
puzzled the young girl.
She finally found the answers when she heard about the
Seeing Eye program, which trains working dogs to
become guides for blind people.
Last year, Susan and her family became Seeing Eye
volunteers. They adopted a Seeing Eye dog when it was
only a few weeks old. “We took a training course with the
Seeing Eye program,” explained Susan. “We learned how
to raise the puppy. We treated it like a family member. We
took it with us wherever we went. We made sure that it
spent a lot of time getting used to the city, the traffic, the
noise, and the people.”
It takes at least two years to teach Seeing Eye dogs all the
skills they need to guide a blind person around a busy city.
When a dog is about one year old, the real training begins.
But there is a lot of work to do before that. That’s where
volunteers like Susan and her family come in.
During the first months of life, Seeing Eye dogs do not live
with professional trainers. Nor do they live with the blind
person they will eventually serve. During those first critical
months, the puppies live with a regular family.
When the dog is about a year old, it leaves its adopted
home. A professional trainer and a blind person teach the
dog the skills it needs to become an expert guide. After a
long and difficult training period, the dog and the blind
person finally team up. For the rest of its life, the Seeing
Eye dog acts as its master’s eyes.
Susan said she got really attached to their first little puppy.
“It was hard when the time came to say goodbye,” she
said. “But we knew that the little dog was going to help
someone who really needed it. I feel good about having
had a small part in giving the gift of independence to
someone who cannot see.”

The Suitcase
My mother sometimes rented out a room in our basement
for extra money. One day, she told us that we were going
to have a new tenant in the basement. Just then, the
doorbell rang and my mother said, “That must be him.”
She let our new tenant in. He sat down and didn’t say a
word. He just nodded his head “yes” or “no” to my
mother’s questions. I was very suspicious of this old man.
I didn’t like him one bit.
I noticed when he went downstairs with my mother to see
the room, that all he had was a small black suitcase and a
bag of clothes.
Weeks passed, but he never said a word to me. That was
fine because I had grown frightened of him from thinking
about what might be in his mysterious suitcase.
One day, I decided I had to find out what he kept in the
case. After all, he could be a dangerous criminal! Maybe
I would find a clue about the old man. When he left for the
day, I sneaked into his room and looked for the suitcase. I
couldn’t find it anywhere. I was about to give up when I
looked up and saw something on top of a high cupboard.
I got a chair and climbed up. There it was! I pulled it down
and put it on the bed. I opened the top and screamed.
It was an arm! Wait... it was a mechanical arm.
“Can I help you?” boomed a voice from behind me.
The old man looked at me and then smiled. “Isn’t it a
beauty?” he said. He told me that he had designed the
arm for people who had lost an arm in accidents or in war.
This was the one great thing he had accomplished in his
life and he was very proud of it.
The old man became my good friend. I hope one day to
be able to design limbs for people just like he did. I know
that would make him proud.
You know, sometimes heroes are living right in your own
house!

The Eiffel Tower: A Paris Story
Paris is a city with many historic buildings and
monuments. Everywhere you look, there are reminders of
France’s glorious past.
But did you know that the most famous historic building in
Paris is not really old at all? It’s just a little over 100 years
old. That’s a spring chicken compared to the Palais of
Versailles, for whose construction began in 1664.
Every year, nearly seven million people visit the Eiffel
Tower. Most people around the world can recognize it in a
picture.
When people think of Paris, they first think of this 324-
metre steel tower. It was built between the years 1887 and
1889. From the very beginning, the Eiffel Tower was
controversial. In 1889, Paris was holding the World Fair. In
those days, this was a prestigious honour. A contest was
held for a building to be erected to commemorate the 100 th
anniversary of the French Revolution.
Gustave Eiffel won this contest with his proposal to build
the steel structure that is so famous today. The
intellectuals and others in Parisian society were against
the design from the beginning. Some of the great French
philosophers spoke out strongly against it. Many felt that
the building should be made of stone or marble – anything
but steel. They wanted the building to reflect Parisian
tradition.
But Eiffel built his tower. It held the title as the world’s
tallest building until the Empire State Building in the US
was built 40 years later.
Here are a few facts about the tower: if you walk to the top
(although most people take the elevator), you will climb
1,671 steps; the Eiffel tower is covered with 40 tons of
paint; at the top, it can sway nearly 15 centimetres in a
high wind; its total weight is 8.5 million kilograms; it cost
about 1.5 million dollars to build and it was assembled by
300 steel workers.
The Eiffel Tower was almost demolished in 1909 when the
lease for the land ran out. Luckily, it survived.
It’s impossible to think of Paris without thinking of this
famous landmark -- the Eiffel Tour. It began in controversy,
but today it’s a symbol of Paris.

Money: A Fair Medium of Exchange
From the earliest days when a cow could be traded for a
horse, to the 21st century when that same horse might
easily be purchased with one swipe of a bank card,
humans have always needed a way to buy and sell things
at an agreed price.
Long ago, a farmer who had too much grain might trade
the surplus for cloth made by someone down the road. A
system like this is called a barter system.
It worked well for a long time. However, things grew more
complicated as population numbers rose. Everyday life in
such a world demanded a standard unit to measure the
value of one thing against another.
The era of money soon followed. And it has been with us
ever since, in various forms.
The Chinese were the first to move from the bartering era
to the money era, beginning with the use of cowrie shells
as early as 3,000 years ago. People traded these shells
for the products they wanted.
A few hundred years later, the Chinese began to
manufacture synthetic cowrie shells from metals such as
copper and bronze. By 100 BC, they introduced the first
banknotes. Small squares of hand-decorated pieces of
leather became common forms of money.
In Europe, money coins soon came into existence. Unlike
the Chinese, Europeans used precious metals such as
gold and silver. Soon, paper money became the preferred
currency because it was much easier to carry around and
to store.
This system worked until the early 19th century when life
grew even more complicated. The Bank of England
introduced “gold-backed” paper money, and tied it to an
agreed price in gold. Now, anyone could simply redeem
their paper banknotes for a commodity with value -- in this
case gold or silver.

A Wish Comes True
(based on a traditional Eastern European legend)
Have you ever felt unhappy about your home? How about
your situation in life? Do you want to make some changes,
but cannot figure out how to do it?
Well, there once lived a man who had a problem like this.
He lived with his wife and children in a very small house.
There was always noise in his house as his children
played, laughed and sang. No matter where he turned, he
could find no peace at all.
Life in this noisy and crowed house was unbearable. So
the man decided to seek advice from a wise old woman
who lived down the road. He told her about his problem.
As she was a wise lady, she immediately had an answer
for him.
“Go home and bring all of your farm animals indoors to
live in your house,” advised the woman. “Bring in your
sheep, horses, cows, chickens, dogs and geese,” she
said. The man thought this to be bad advice. But since the
old woman was known far and wide for her wisdom, he
agreed to do as she said. He went home and brought
inside all the farm animals he had in his possession.
As you can imagine, there was great disruption in the
home. The animals made all kinds of noise. Wherever he
went in his house, there was confusion. The dogs barked.
The sheep cried. The chickens clucked and the cows
bawled.
The man could find no comfort, no peace at all, so he
went back to consult with the wise old woman. She had
been expecting him. She listened patiently to his
complaint, and then offered some new advice. “Go home
and take all of the animals out of your home,” she said.
The man was confused, as it had been only a few days
since she had advised him to bring them all into his house.
But as she was wise, he agreed to follow her instructions.
He returned to his house and drove all the animals
outside. To his surprise, there was quiet and tranquility in
his home.
Sometimes, we need to see how bad things can get
before we appreciate what we already have.

Winning Isn’t Everything
Jimmy was good at everything. He was a good athlete. He
was good at music. He did good in school. I couldn’t stand
the fact that he was always first in everything he did.
So when I heard that there was going to be a soapbox
race, I thought, “This is my chance to teach him to be
more humble.”
Everyone worked hard all week to build the best race car.
The day of the race, I saw his racer. Of course, it was
beautiful. It was red and had a big flame on the side. It
was smooth and had wheels that looked very expensive.
I was so upset and angry that I did something I should not
have. When he wasn’t looking I kicked one of his
expensive wheels. “Now let’s see who wins!” I thought.
I got back in my racer and waited for the race to start.
BANG!
We were off -- slowly at first, and then faster as we picked
up speed going down the hill.
Jimmy and I were both pulling away from the pack.
Suddenly, his wheel started to wobble badly, and then it
came off! He started to swerve! I realized I had made his
racer dangerous. He couldn’t steer it as we approached
the big turn at the bottom of the hill!
The race was mine to win, but I realized that I could not
win this way, no matter how much I disliked Jimmy. I hit
the brake and grabbed his cart to keep it beside me.
I had to steer and brake for both of us. We stopped just
before the edge of the road, and the other racers flew past
us.
He thanked me for saving him.
“Jimmy,” I said, “I kicked your wheel because I could not
stand to see you win again. I’m sorry.”
It was hard to admit what I had done, but Jimmy forgave
me and we eventually became good friends. I realized that
winning isn’t everything, and so did Jimmy.

The Three Sisters
“Iceberg ahead!”
Those words were shouted by a lookout on the deck of the
great ship Titanic, the night of April 14, 1912. It was her
first voyage. Over the next few hours, people screamed in
fear as they realized the ship was sinking in the middle of
the cold Atlantic Ocean.
The story of disaster aboard the Titanic made news
around the world. People sat in disbelief, hearing that the
“unsinkable” ship had sunk to the bottom of the ocean.
The Titanic hit an iceberg and sank in less than three
hours. Of the 2,223 people aboard the Titanic, only 706
survived the disaster. There were only enough lifeboats for
about half the people. Why? The ship’s owners felt that
the ship was unsinkable.
They had good reasons to believe the ship would never
sink. The Titanic was the largest passenger steamship in
the world. She was 269 metres long and 28 metres wide.
She weighed 46,328 tons, and her height from the water
to the deck was 18 metres.
She had four huge smoke stacks that were 19 metres
high, but only three carried smoke. The fourth was added
just to make the ship look even larger!
The ship had a gym and a swimming pool, a Turkish bath,
libraries and a squash court.
It was expensive to travel on this amazing ship. The most
expensive ticket cost $4,350, which could buy a very nice
house in 1912!
Many people don’t know that the Titanic had a sister ship
called the Britannic that was just like her.
As a result of what happened to the Titanic, the Britannic
was made much safer. In fact, she was so safe that she
was used as a hospital ship. In 1916, she struck a mine in
the Aegean Sea. Even though she had been improved,
with many new safety features added, the Britannic sank
even faster than her sister.
Luckily, there was a third sister ship called the Olympic.
She served many years and was finally taken out of
service in 1935. Unlike her two sisters, she never sank
and was called “Old Reliable”.

What Is Silk?
Silk was discovered by the Chinese more than 3,000
years ago. It was said that the wife of the Yellow Emperor
accidentally dropped a silkworm cocoon into her tea. The
hot liquid caused the cocoon to unravel. As it broke apart,
she realized its beauty.
From these humble beginnings, the silk industry began.
At first, only the rich were allowed to wear silk.
As early as 300 AD, Chinese merchants were selling silk
to the Indians. By 200 BC, the Koreans had learned how
to make silk. Some silkworms had been smuggled out of
China. The process was repeated when silkworms were
smuggled to the Middle East, where the Persians learned
how to make silk.
A 12,000-kilometre road stretching from China to Europe
was constructed because of silk. From there, knowledge
of silk production spread across the globe.
Here’s a simple version of how this amazing little insect
does its work.
The silkworm begins life as a moth. The moth’s lifespan is
about ten days, during which it lays eggs that hatch into
silkworms. Silkworms eat a lot. In their short lives, 20,000
silkworms will eat more than one ton of mulberry leaves,
their main food.
In its final stage of life, the silkworm spins a cocoon using
saliva from its silk glands. The finished cocoon contains
350 metres of silk. That might seem like a lot, but consider
this: 5,500 silkworms have to spin 5,500 cocoons to make
one kilogram of silk.
Raising silkworms for raw silk production is known as
“sericulture”. The Chinese have perfected the art of
sericulture, gaining intricate knowledge over many
centuries -- often by trial and error.
Today, silk production remains an important economic
venture in China. While synthetic versions have recently
entered the market, the beauty of naturally produced silk
is unmatched.
Silk no longer costs an arm and a leg, but it is still a highly
prized commodity.

Nature Makes It Better
(adapted from an ancient Indian legend)
People sometimes look at nature and fail to see its
perfection. They think that if they could play around with
the way nature created something, they could make it
better.
For example, they look at a plant and think, “How much
better this plant would be if only its flowers were more
beautiful?” Or they see a summer rain and think, “If I had
designed the world, I would have made it so that it never
rains in the summer when people are on vacation.”
Such was the case long ago when a weary traveler settled
in for a rest under a beautiful nut tree. As he sat and
looked around, he observed a large pumpkin growing in a
nearby garden. He noticed that the vine on which the
massive pumpkin grew was small and weak.
Above him, in the sturdy nut tree, he observed small round
nuts hanging on strong limbs. “How foolish nature is!” he
remarked to himself. “If nature had half a brain, it would
have made these heavy pumpkins grow on this strong oak
tree. And it would have placed the small nuts on that
weak, thin vine. That, no doubt, is how it should have
been. If I had been the creator, I surely would have done it
that way.”
The traveller leaned back against the tree trunk, happy to
know that his intelligence was above that of the creator of
all things in the natural world. Just then, a tiny nut fell from
the tree, hitting the traveller on the top of his head.
Immediately, he saw the defect in his thinking. He realized
how things might have been different if it had been the
huge pumpkin that had fallen from high in the tree and hit
him on the head. “I surely would have died in such an
event,” he said aloud.
And as he went on his way, he had a new admiration for
nature and its perfect design.

My Favourite Teacher
His name is Mr. Nobes. I met him when I was in Grade 7.
What was special about him? He had a great sense of
humour. That was the biggest thing for us.
He was always sending students down to the office to get
things. One day, he sent me. I had never had this chance
before, so I walked around a bit. When I got back, he
yelled, “Why did you take so long? Next time, I’ll send a
dead horse.” The class laughed and I got the message.
One time, he got sick and went to the hospital for surgery.
He didn’t have any close family in town, so we decided to
visit him. About twenty of us showed up at the hospital and
told the nurse we wanted to see our teacher.
She said we could go in five at a time. I was in the first
group. We walked down the hall quietly. We knocked on
the door first because we weren’t sure if he wanted to see
us. But when he saw us, his face lit up! He looked at us as
if he couldn’t quite believe it.
We brought him all kinds of joke gifts. People laughed the
most when I gave my gift. It was a funny drawing of a
dead horse with his legs straight up in the air.
After a while, the whole floor was filled with kids. Many of
us went to visit patients we didn’t even know. The whole
place grew loud, and everybody’s spirits were high.
It was amazing to see how happy people were to have
visitors.
Soon, Mr. Nobes recovered. He came back to school and
told the class how much he appreciated us visiting him.
He said he had a special gift to give the class in return. He
told us to close our eyes. When we opened our eyes, he
was holding a plastic horse glued to a piece of wood that
had writing on it.
It said, “To the Dead Horse class. Long may you run!”
The rest of the day was no different from any other day
with Mr. Nobes. We learned and we laughed.
