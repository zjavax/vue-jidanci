Paper Planes
Today in science class, we made paper airplanes. Our
teacher said, “We will see which airplane flies the
farthest.”
Everyone wanted his or her airplane to fly far. Of course, I
wanted mine to fly farther than the others. I wanted it to fly
the farthest of all. We stood at the front of the class and
took turns throwing our airplanes.
The teacher had a ruler. She measured how far each
airplane travelled. Some airplanes did not go far. They
flew only two metres and then fell to the floor. Most of the
airplanes went farther. They travelled seven or eight
metres before falling.
It was my turn. I stood at the starting line and said, “One,
two, three, go!” I threw it as hard as I was able to. I
eagerly watched it fly high above the floor. After about six
or seven long seconds, it landed almost at the back of the
room.
“Ten metres!” said our teacher. “That is far. That is the
farthest. Yeah, that’s it! I did it!” I jumped and was very
happy.
Then, there was only one boy left. He threw his airplane
into the air. It flew across the room steadily, straight and
far. Finally, it landed a little farther than mine. The teacher
laughed. “This is the farthest,” she said. “Bill’s airplane
flew the farthest of all.”
Bill smiled proudly. He ran to pick up his airplane and
showed it to us. It turns out that he added a paper clip at
the front of the airplane.
Everyone applauded Bill. Although I didn’t win and I didn’t
tie with Bill either, I was happy with the result. It was good
enough for me. Without adding any devices, my paper
plane flew the farthest.
I am a happy flyer!

A Shark Visit
Yesterday, I went on a tour to see great white sharks in the
ocean. It was so exciting! I love the ocean, and I love to
learn about the creatures living there.
Did you know that sharks have been on earth for more
than 400 million years? Wow!
Sharks are so misunderstood by most people. Many don’t
even know that sharks are fish. All they know is that
sharks are dangerous -- especially the great white sharks.
But in reality, sharks are not dangerous.
The movie Jaws did a lot of harm to sharks. You know --
the movie that shows a great white shark attacking and
killing a lot of swimmers. So everyone thinks that great
whites do nothing all day but look for people to eat.
In fact, there are only about 30 to 50 great white shark
attacks on humans each year. You have a greater chance
of being attacked by a dog or a pig. You stand a greater
chance of being struck by lightning than of being attacked
by a great white shark. Still, the myth persists.
That’s why I was so excited about our tour to see the great
white sharks. I wanted to see them up close. I wanted to
learn all about them so I could educate my friends about
sharks.
A group of six of us met the tour guide in the morning, and
he took us out on the boat. When we got far enough from
the shore, the guide stopped the boat and put some meat
in the ocean to attract the sharks.
After a few minutes, a great white came close to our boat.
One by one, we got in the small cage at the end of the
boat, which the guide then lowered under the water so we
could see the shark. It was so big! I can’t believe I was
brave enough to get into that cage.
Did you know that great white sharks have 3,000 teeth?
And some sharks can live to be 100 years old. I also
learned that sharks do not have bones. Around the world,
countless numbers of sharks are killed by fishermen each
year.
Yes, indeed. Sharks are really misunderstood. But as I
watched them up close from the safety of the cage, I felt
I had learned a little more about them.

Ice Fishing
Sara sat in her class, listening to her teacher talk about life
in water. It was her first winter in Canada. She knew that
the lakes froze during the winter. But what happens to the
water animals? Where do they go?
Her teacher explained that even in the coldest winter, the
lake doesn’t freeze right to the bottom. Below the ice, fish
are still there living their lives.
At recess, her best friend Lisa said, “One of my favourite
winter activities is ice fishing.” “Ice fishing? What’s that?”
Sara asked. Lisa smiled, “My grandfather and I are going
ice fishing this weekend. Would you like to come with us?
You will learn what ice fishing is. And it’s fun! I promise.”
After receiving permission from her parents, Sara joined
Lisa and her grandfather on the ice fishing trip.
At the lake, the girls waited on shore while Grandfather
drilled a test hole. “It must be at least 25 centimetres
thick,” he explained. “Safety is the most important thing.”
He used his power drill to make a hole in the ice. He then
measured the thickness. “More than 40 centimetres,” he
said. “Safe enough. Let’s go fishing!”
At a spot in the middle of the lake, they drilled three holes
through the ice, each big enough to pull a large fish
through.
Then, Lisa took out three “fishing poles”. They were not at
all like the poles used for summer fishing. Each pole was
simply a length of fishing line and a hook, attached to a
stick.
“This is your fishing hole here,” explained Lisa. “Just let
your line sink, and then hold on tight! Remember, fish are
hungry in winter.”
They sat there on the frozen lake, the sun high and the
day cold, but beautiful. Around them, other fishermen were
ice fishing too.
Soon, Sara felt a strong tug at the end of her line.
Grandfather noticed it too. “Hurry!” he said. “Start pulling!”
She jerked on the line and felt a heavy load at the other
end. She began to pull the line up. Lisa stood there
cheering her on. Soon, Sara could see a fish on her line
through the half-frozen hole.
Sara could hardly believe her luck. On her first try at ice
fishing she had landed a large fish. Grandfather
congratulated her. “You are like a real Canadian today,” he
said. “You can take your fish home for supper with your
parents tonight.”

School Picnic Day
My mom often tells me stories. One of her stories is about
the school picnic. At that time, schools didn’t have a track
and field day like we have now. Instead, the biggest day
for them was the School Picnic Day.
The School Picnic Day was usually held on the last day of
school in June. On that day, kids played simple games. No
one cared who won and who lost.
Soon, before anyone knew it, it was lunchtime. Parents
always packed picnic baskets for the kids. They filled them
with as many good foods as they could afford.
There was one family that was very poor. They had no
picnic lunch that year. When my mom noticed this, she
quickly tried to figure out how to help them. She knew they
would be embarrassed if she gave them something from
her own lunch basket.
Just then, the teacher announced there was going to be
one final race before lunch. It would be the sack race, in
which two people get inside a sack and hop as fast as
they can to the finish line. The winner would receive a
special lunch basket prepared by the teachers.
My mom wanted to enter this race. She waited until she
saw Mary, the oldest sister of the family, get up. She
asked Mary if she could be her partner, and Mary agreed.
My mom had never been good at races, but as she put
her legs into that sack with Mary, she told herself, “You
can do it. You have to win!”
The teacher yelled, “Ready. Set. Go!” And the race was
on. The trick with the sack race is to keep from falling
down. If you can keep standing, hopping and moving
forward, you have a good chance. Most kids usually fall
down right away, but this time my mom hopped in time
with Mary. They pulled out in front and never looked back.
Their classmates were cheering.
Later, Mary came and thanked my mom for being her
partner. She said that her brothers and sisters really
enjoyed their picnic lunch. Then, she handed my mom a
sandwich. The two girls sat together in the warm sun,
eating the last two sandwiches. According to Mom, it was
the best school picnic in the whole world.

A Nervous Flyer
I really don’t like planes. I mean I like them, but I am a little
nervous about the flying part.
One time, I had to take a flight. Even though I was worried
about it, I knew I had to go. I went to the airport and
boarded the plane. An older woman sat down beside me.
She smiled at me.
The plane was ready to take off and I was feeling
extremely nervous. I was so nervous that I was sweating
and my hands were shaking. I was panicking.
The plane started to pick up speed. I was just about to
grab someone’s hand when the older woman grabbed my
hand and said, “I’m so scared. Can I hold your hand?”
Well, I was shocked and said, “Okay.” We held each
other’s hands tightly. The plane took off and climbed into
the sky.
Soon the plane settled down. The flight went along very
well. The old lady and I talked about everything you could
imagine. She seemed to know a lot about the world.
Just as the flight was coming to an end, the pilot
announced on the speaker, “Ladies and gentlemen, this is
Captain Williams. This is a special flight for me. Today, I
am retiring after 30 years as a pilot. My whole family is on
board to celebrate my last landing in a jet. I’m going to
make it as smooth as glass for you.”
There were big smiles in the cabin. People were excited
as we neared the runway. The pilot brought the plane
lower and lower. Finally, the plane touched down on the
runway. As the plane glided to a smooth stop, everyone on
board broke into applause and cheered.
In the front of the plane, I could see people clapping as
the pilot came through the plane. He stopped by my seat
and the older lady stood up and hugged the pilot. She was
his wife!
The woman said goodbye to me and left with the pilot. On
the way out, I said to the flight attendants, “Isn’t it strange
that the pilot’s wife has never been on a plane?” The two
flight attendants laughed and said, “Mrs. Williams was a
flight attendant for twenty years.”
And with that, I realized that what she had done was to
help me.

The Many Ways of Sleeping
Sleep. It’s something that all mammals, birds, and reptiles
do.
We all need sleep, but different species have adapted to it
in different ways, according to the conditions of their
environments. You can, in fact, tell a lot about an animal
by studying the way it sleeps.
For example, for humans, it’s natural to lie down on one’s
back or stomach and drift off to sleep. That’s easy enough
to do when you’re at the top of the food chain and don’t
have natural enemies. Lying down to sleep leaves one
open to attack, so only those creatures with few enemies
regularly sleep like that.
Caution and safety are at the forefront of many animals’
minds when sleeping.
Did you know that elephants sleep standing up? The same
is true for cows, horses, and sheep. When these animals
go into the dream state, they lie down. But, the majority of
their sleep occurs while they are standing.
Many of these larger land animals rely on speed in flight to
protect them from predators. Their ability to lock their leg
joints and sleep while standing gives them an advantage if
they come under attack while snoozing.
Imagine the disadvantage if they had to wake from sleep
while lying on the ground and then rise to their legs before
taking flight.
Birds sleep in a similar way, and it is assumed, for similar
reasons -- safety. They simply lock their claws around their
perch, and go to sleep. This allows them to enter the sleep
state in a relatively safe location, high up in a tree.
As a rule of thumb, the smaller the animal is, the more
sleep it needs. Giraffes need only two hours of sleep per
day while bats sleep for a whopping twenty hours every
day. Fully developed humans require about eight hours a
day, which is a couple of hours more than their closest
cousins, chimpanzees.
No doubt about it, all animals need sleep. And they have
many way to get it.

The Little Bird and Fire
(adapted from a Canadian native legend)
At the beginning of time, the earth was warm, and food
was everywhere. People did not need fire. They ate their
food raw, and sometimes they used the hot sun to cook it.
But slowly, the world grew colder. People huddled together
in their cold homes and were freezing.
One day, a beautiful bird with a bright orange tail came to
speak with them. “You are cold,” said the bird. “You need
to have fire so you can warm your houses and you’re your
food. I have fire and will give it to you.”
But the bird did not give it easily. It wanted the people to
appreciate fire. It said, “I will give fire only to those who
deserve it. I will give it only to people who know what it is
to help others. Do you agree?” asked the bird.
Everyone agreed. So the bird said, “See this orange on
my tail? Bring some dry wood. When you touch my tail
with the wood, you will have fire.” The people came
eagerly with dry wood. But the bird quickly flew away.
Everyone chased after it, trying to touch the orange tail
with their sticks. But the bird was fast, and people could
not catch it. They fell down mountains and into lakes as
they chased the fire bird.
In the end, only two people were left chasing the bird. One
got close and just as he tried to touch the bird’s tail, the
bird flew away, saying, “You are not kind. You have anger
in your heart. You treat people badly.”
Then, the last man got close. But the bird said, “You are
selfish. You take and do not give back. I will never let you
have fire from my tail!”
As the fire bird was flying away, it noticed a young woman
sitting alone with a very old man. It landed beside them
and said, “Why are you not chasing after fire like all the
rest?” The woman said, “This is my grandfather. He is
sick, and I must care for him. That is all.”
The bird came close to the woman. “Touch a stick to my
orange tail,” said the bird, “for you are the only one among
your people worthy of this great gift.”
And so, fire came to the people.

I Was Late!
I still can’t believe that I missed it. I missed the chance to
meet our national soccer team! Just a little more effort on
my part, and everything would have turned out well. I
mean, if you really want to do something, you put in the
effort to make it happen. Right? That’s what my parents
always tell me. I wish I had listened to that advice.
It’s too late now. Last week, I missed the chance of a
lifetime!
I was invited to go on a special trip to meet the national
soccer team. I was so excited!
The trip was all I could think about for days. We would be
introduced to some of the best soccer players in the whole
nation. We were supposed to meet the bus at our school
early on Saturday morning. My teacher told me to be on
time. “Be here at 7:30 in the morning. Don’t be late, or the
bus will leave without you.”
The night before the big trip, I could not fall asleep. I lay in
bed imagining how special the trip would be. Finally,
I fell asleep.
When the alarm clock woke me up, it was 6:30. It’s a 30-
minute bus ride from home to school. I had plenty of time.
I hit the OFF button on the alarm clock. I rolled over and
went back to sleep. I just wanted to sleep five more
minutes.
Then all of a sudden, I woke up. It was almost 7 o’clock!
“Oh no! I should be on my bus at this time,” I cried. But
there I was, still in bed. I had overslept by half an hour!
I ran to the bus station. It seemed that the bus would
never arrive. There was no taxi in sight either.
After waiting at the bus station for fifteen minutes, I
decided to run to the school. I ran as fast as possible.
When I arrived at school, it was 8:15. I was late.
The bus had left without me.

When You Don’t Know
Back in the 1960s, when I first heard the word “cancer”, I
was seven years old. My two sisters were ten and twelve.
It hit us hard when one of our uncles passed away at the
age of 48. We overheard the adults saying that he died of
cancer.
Cancer? What was cancer? My mother told us that it’s a
lump inside of one’s body, and it’s very hard to cure. My
uncle had gastric cancer -- a cancer in the stomach.
That night when we were in bed, all of us were scared.
One of my sisters started to check her abdomen to see if
there was a lump. After using her fingers to press
everywhere, especially in her stomach area, she felt
something like a small lump. She thought she had cancer.
She pressed hard from left to right to compare. Then she
confirmed her conclusion. Soon, my other sister did the
same thing. She used her hand to touch her back and
front, and checked from side to side. She found something
hard too. I followed their lead and checked my body.
Before long, I pinpointed lumps in my neck. We all found
lumps!
“Mom!” my sister cried. “What’s wrong?” Mom came to our
room quickly. “We have cancer,” my sister said. “What?”
asked Mom. “Yes, all three of us found lumps.”
Mom listened carefully and checked our lumps separately.
Then she laughed, “Don’t be silly. That’s your bone, Anne.
Kelly, you’re touching your bones too.”
Mom continued, “Our bodies have 206 bones. Some are
big and some are small. Many of them feel like lumps. But
not all lumps are cancer. I understand that the word
“cancer” made you start with this. But it’s not very common
to have cancer. Don’t worry about it for now. Okay? Eat
well. Rest well. Your body’s immune system will safeguard
you from illness. You will grow up healthy, okay? Good
night!”

We went to sleep, hoping to have sweet dreams.

In the Spirit of Fairness
Do you think that the Olympics are all about winning? Not
always. Here’s something that happened during the 2006
Winter Games. It shows the true Olympic spirit.
In the middle of a huge race, the Norwegian cross-country
skiing coach did something really fantastic. And it had
nothing to do with helping his team win a medal.
It was the two-person women’s relay race. The Canadians
and the Norwegians were among the favourites to win.
Which team would take home the Gold?
The race was going well for both the Canadians and the
women from Norway. Somewhere near the middle of the
race, one of the Canadians broke one of her ski poles.
There was no way to win now. You could see the look of
despair on the young Canadian skier’s face. She was
watching her lifelong dream disappear before her eyes.
Suddenly, the coach from Norway came running from the
sidelines. He had a ski pole in his hand and passed it to
the Canadian skier. She looked at him, confused for a
second, and then grabbed the new pole and raced away
as fast as she could. In the end, the Canadian girls came
second, finishing ahead of the Norwegians.
In Norway, some people were angry with their coach. They
felt he was a traitor to his own team. Then, people started
to understand what the coach had really done. He could
have stood there watching as the Canadians lost. But he
decided to help. To him, it was the right thing to do. In a
television interview, he said that winning the race because
the other team had an equipment failure would not be fair.
Of course, he wanted his girls to win -- but not at any cost.
Later, the coach was treated like a hero. People
understood that his actions were those of a true
sportsman. He put the spirit of fairness ahead of the
desire to win at all costs. That’s the Olympic spirit.

Christmas Memory
Christmas is a wonderful time of year. Today, kids receive
far more gifts than they really need. It seems as if all they
have to do is ask.
But when I was growing up, there was no money in our
family. We were poor.
My father tried his best. He usually sold five turkeys raised
by us on the farm and used the extra money to buy each
of us an orange. This was our Christmas present each
year. And we all loved to receive it.
But this year, the townsfolks had no money and were
unable to buy my father’s fat turkeys. He could get no
money to buy our gift of oranges.
So, my father came home and told us all in a grave and
serious manner that Santa Claus had been in a huge
accident near the North Pole, and he would be unable to
make his regular Christmas visits on time. We believed
Father of course, and not one of us complained. We
accepted the story and did not expect any Christmas gift
that year.
We made do with what we had. My mother cooked a
turkey dinner, baking two of the unsold birds in the oven of
the wood-burning stove. We had potatoes and carrots,
turnips and gravy, and the richest apple pie! Later, we
played outdoors in the new snow. And that evening, we
sang Christmas songs around a warm fire.
A few months later, when we went down for breakfast, we
found our Christmas stockings hanging on the wall. In
each stocking was one orange for each of us.
We screamed and laughed, “Santa did come to visit us!”
We hugged each other. We peeled our oranges and had
one small piece, allowing the sweet juices to run slowly
down our throats.
We saved the rest for later, eating a piece here and a
piece there all through that day. We savoured each morsel
of orange, allowing not one drop of its precious juice to fall
to the floor.
I always remember that Christmas, even if it was two
months late.

The Talking Machine
Today making a phone call is as common as having a
glass of water. But when telephones were invented more
than 130 years ago, people believed that they were
dangerous.
In 1876, when the first telephone was demonstrated to the
public, electricity was still new and little understood. Many
people had died working with electricity in the early days.
That’s why most people did not easily accept that it was
safe to hear a human voice through the phone. Many
honestly feared the phone would kill them.
But on the morning of March 10, 1876, Alexander Bell,
and his assistant Thomas Watson, had no such fears. Bell
and Watson had been struggling to make their new
invention, the telephone, work. Bell sent his assistant to a
room in the basement. In a room upstairs, the telephone
inventor spoke seven little words into his invention. These
simple words changed the world forever. “Mr. Watson,
come here. I want you.”
It’s hard to imagine the excitement in the laboratory that
day. Mr. Watson did, in fact, hear these words on his
receiving machine in the basement. He quickly ran
upstairs to announce the good news to his boss.
The telephone was born in March 1876, but it took a few
more years for it to gain respect. Bell had to overcome the
fears about electricity before people took his invention
seriously. He also had to convince people there was a
need for such a machine.
We can laugh at this now, but in 1876, people seriously
asked, “But what use could it possibly have?”
Today, we take telephones for granted. But on that day in
March 1876, there were only two telephones in the whole
world.
As we walk along a busy street talking with friends on our
cellphones, it is hard to believe that not so long ago,
telephones were thought to be dangerous and useless.
Our world sure has changed, don’t you think so?

Two Brothers, One Dream
There once were two young brothers, Simon and Pedro,
who dreamed of going to university to become engineers.
There was just one problem. They came from a poor
family in a small town that was far from any university.
The only way they could make their dream come true was
that one of them worked in the local mine to pay for the
other to go to school, and when the first one became an
engineer, he would pay for the other to go to school.
They flipped a coin. Simon won, but he said, “I can’t go.
You are much smarter than me!” But Pedro convinced him
to go. Simon headed off to school, and Pedro worked to
send money to pay for the schooling.
Simon was the hardest working student there. He soon
became known as the best student. But he always told
people that his brother was the really smart one. He would
proudly show everyone Pedro’s designs for machines.
One day, near the end of the first year of school, there was
an accident at the mine. Pedro was injured quite badly
and would never be able to work in the mine again.
Without money, Simon had to quit school. He took care of
his brother in their little village. They were both terribly
sad.
One day, an expensive car pulled up to their little house.
Out of the car came an administrator from the university.
“Simon, we want you to come back to school, and we’ll
pay for it,” he said.
Simon was shocked. “I’m sorry,” he said, “but I can’t leave
my brother.” The teacher replied, “You won’t have to. I’ve
seen Pedro’s designs, and he is too smart for us not to
accept him too.”
Soon, Pedro regained his health and the two brothers
went to school. They became great engineers and helped
build many buildings in their country. They also helped
others from their little town go to school.
Cooperation, hard work and a dream. These are the keys
to a great future!

Camels -- A Perfect Design
We’ve all seen pictures of camels carrying heavy loads
across the sandy desert. For days on end, they walk
without stopping for food or water.
Have you ever wondered how they do it? For your answer,
take a look at the big round hump sticking up on a camel’s
back.
Camels are the only animals with humps. And it’s the
hump that gives camels the amazing ability to go for long
periods of time without food or water. The hump is like a
spare cupboard where the camel stores food and water for
days when there is nothing to eat or drink.
When life is good, and there is plenty to eat and drink, a
camel’s hump grows and grows. It can grow to as big as
40 kilograms under good eating conditions. The food is
changed into fat and stored in the camel’s hump.
When there is nothing to eat or drink, camels
automatically begin to use the stored fat in their hump.
That’s why they can survive for weeks without food and up
to ten days without water.
Camels are like sponges. They can take in more than 130
litres of water in one short drink. That’s a lot of water! In
only a few minutes, all of this water goes directly to the
camel’s blood cells.
Camels conserve water too. Nothing is wasted. They
never know when they’ll find the next watering hole. As
they breathe out, their noses close quickly. The moisture
in the breath stays in their bodies.
Every little drop of water helps in the desert.
After a long trek across the desert carrying 100 kilograms
or more, a camel can lose up to 150 kilograms of weight.
The camel’s hump will become very small. The camel will
look sick. Don’t worry, though. As soon as this camel gets
to an oasis, it will take in hundreds of litres of water. In a
few minutes, it will start to look better. In a day, it will have
regained most of its weight.
Nature really has given camels the perfect system for
surviving the hard desert life.

Life Is a Swimming Pool
You never know where life will lead you. When I was a
young boy, my older sister Becky always seemed to
overshadow me. It’s not that she wanted to do that, or
even that she ever tried to do it.
When your sister is both a great athlete and a great
student, it’s just natural that people will notice her
accomplishments, and not notice what her little brother is
doing. Sometimes, it’s just hard to be the little brother of
someone who does everything well.
Becky was the best swimmer in our province. I never liked
swimming. One time, as a kid, I got water up my nose and
never wanted to get in the water again. And since Becky
was such a great swimmer, I was just in her shadow
again.
Swimming was not for me.
One day, I fell off my skateboard and broke my leg so
badly that the doctors said I could never really skateboard
again. They said there was only one exercise that would
be good for me -- swimming!
Well, I gave it a try. Every week, I got a little better and
hated swimming a little less. I worked at it so much that
one day my high school swimming coach asked me to join
the school team. You can imagine how that made me feel,
considering my sister Becky had always been the
swimming star in our family.
Much to everyone’s surprise, I ended up winning a bronze
medal in the city finals.
Becky? She doesn’t swim much anymore. But me? I do.
It’s a big part of my life now.
You never know which road life will take you down. Look
at me -- a swimmer!
For this reason, I say: don’t limit your choices. And
remember, life is a swimming pool. Jump in and start
swimming! You might be surprised where you end up.

The Wise Man and the Fruit Tree
(adapted from a Middle Eastern tale)
There once was a wise man who was very respected for
his wisdom. This great man was called the Wise Circle
Maker. His people believed that he had special powers to
make it rain.
He would make a big circle in the dirt and stand inside of
it. There, he spoke with God and asked for things needed
by the people. Everyone listened to his advice.
But the Wise Circle Maker did not know everything about
life. Often, when he saw things that he did not understand,
he would ask questions, hoping to find the answers.
One day, he was walking in the countryside and noticed a
man planting a fruit tree. He asked the man, “When will
this tree bear fruit? How long will it take?”
The man said that it would take 70 years for fruit to come
to the tree.
“And how old are you now?” asked the Wise Circle Maker.
“I am almost 50 years old,” replied the man.
“And do you think you will live to taste the fruit from this
tree?” asked the Wise Circle Maker.
“I will not live another 70 years,” replied the man. “I am
already old and will never taste the fruit from this tree I
plant. But when I was born, I saw many fruit trees like this
planted by my father, and his father, and his father’s
father. And I ate the fruit from those trees.
“This tree is for my children, my grandchildren and for their
children too. They will taste the fruit of this tree. That is
why I am planting it. Not for me, but for them.”
The Wise Circle Maker was impressed. He could easily
see the meaning. He walked away content, knowing that
he still had much to learn about life.

Lost and Found
One day, while Chris and his friends were playing soccer,
a little dog wandered into his yard. After watching the boys
play, the little dog stood up and wanted to play too. Chris
kicked the ball and the dog ran down the field trying to
catch it. He ran very fast and almost hit the fence.
Everyone laughed. This little dog made the game a lot
more fun to play.
When the game was over, all of Chris’s friends went
home, but the dog stayed behind with Chris. Chris sat on
the step with the dog, hoping his parents would let him
keep it. It was his dream to have a little dog like this one.
As soon as his parents came home, Chris ran towards
them. “Mom, look at this little dog,” he exclaimed. “He likes
me and wants to stay. May I keep it?” he asked eagerly.
“Oh, it’s a lovely dog,” his mom replied. “But, you know the
dog is not ours. The owner of the dog must be very
worried. Don’t you think so?”
“Yeah, I did not think about that,” he replied.
“What should we do then?” Mom asked.
“We should... return him to his home,” Chris said slowly.
He knew it was the right thing to do.
The next morning, Chris made some posters and put them
up around town.
Soon, a young girl called saying that her puppy was lost.
She was sure that it was her dog in the poster. Chris gave
her his address and invited her to come by.
Thirty minutes later, a car stopped in front of his house. A
young girl and her mother got out of the car. The dog
started to bark and bark. He ran towards the girl. She
picked up the little dog and hugged it over and over again.
The puppy was really happy to see the girl.
They thanked the young boy for finding their dog. Of
course, Chris was sad to see the dog go, but he knew he
did the right thing.
And who knows? Perhaps one day he too will have a dog
of his very own.

The Dog and the Cherry Blossom
(adapted from a traditional Japanese story)
A long time ago in Japan, there lived a good man and his
wife. They had a little dog that they loved very much. But
their mean neighbour threw stones at the little dog.
One day, the dog was digging in the yard, so the good
man came out to see what was the matter. When he saw
what the dog was doing, he said, “I will get my shovel and
help you, little dog.” Soon his shovel struck something. He
reached into the hole and found a box filled with fine gold.
The mean man saw this and was jealous. He asked his
neighbour to lend him the dog. The mean man yelled, “Dig
here and find some gold for me.” The little dog started to
dig, but turned up nothing but garbage. “You stupid dog,”
said the mean man, striking the dog with his shovel and
killing it.
The good man was sad. He buried his dog under a small
tree. The tree stretched high to the sky in only a few years.
So the man’s wife said, “Let us cut this tree down and
make a wooden bowl. We will make some rice cakes for
our little dog, for he always loved rice cakes.”
As they pounded the rice into cakes in the bowl, the rice
turned to gold. The good man and his wife became rich.
The mean neighbour borrowed the bowl and began to
pound rice in it, but he found only smelly garbage. The
man burned the bowl in anger. The kind man came and
took the ashes and spread them under a cherry tree in his
yard.
It was winter and as you know, cherry trees do not
blossom in winter. But right away, this tree put out the
most beautiful flowers. Everyone in the land heard about
this, and came to see the tree blooming out of season.
The prince had a sick and dying cherry tree that he loved
dearly. He asked if he might borrow some of the ashes.
The good man agreed.
When the prince spread the ashes under his tree, it came
back to life and the flowers were splendid. The prince was
so happy. He made the good man and his wife even
richer. He also made them honoured in the land.

Tomato -- Fruit or Vegetable?
Tomatoes. Soft and red. Sweet and juicy. They are one of
the world’s oldest foods. If you like pizza, you enjoy
tomatoes. If you like a little ketchup with your french fries,
you love tomatoes.
Tomatoes were discovered by the Indians of South
America, thousands of years ago. The first tomatoes were
very small. By the time the Europeans brought them to
Europe in the 1500s, they were larger. They looked more
like the tomatoes we eat today.
The history of tomatoes is an interesting one. When they
first arrived in Italy, they were known as “love apples”.
Italians believed that if you ate a tomato, you would easily
fall in love.
In the United States, people believed that tomatoes were
poisonous, and that you would die immediately upon
eating one. It wasn’t easy to persuade people otherwise.
That is, until 1820, when Robert Johnson decided to prove
people wrong. He announced that he would publicly eat
one bushel of tomatoes -- about 50. A huge crowd showed
up to watch. They were sure that Mr. Johnson was going
to die. Of course, he survived. And the tomato went on to
gain a big place in the American diet.
In the beginning, people argued whether tomatoes were a
fruit or a vegetable. From a purely scientific point of view,
they are a fruit. A fruit is the ripened ovary of any plant that
makes seeds. However, this didn’t stop most people from
calling tomatoes a vegetable. They reasoned that
tomatoes are eaten with the main meal -- just like
vegetables. They are not eaten as dessert, like other fruits
such as apples or bananas. Therefore, they thought the
tomato must surely be a vegetable.
Fruit or vegetable, tomatoes have survived a long time.
They are not likely to disappear any time soon. They are
just too good to eat!

King of Fruits
Have you ever tasted something that you really did not
like? Would you try it again? Maybe you should because
sometimes you have to give a certain food a second or
even a third chance if you really want to appreciate them.
My best friend Brian told us a good story the other day
about durians, a fruit found in Southeast Asia. Brian’s
family loves fruits. They eat all kinds of fruits, but they had
never tasted a fruit like the durian before.
Three years ago, Brian was introduced to this durian when
he worked as a contractor for a hydro project in Malaysia.
Every year, the boss invited his workers to eat durians
when they were in season. He rented a bus to take all the
workers to the garden where the fruits were harvested. He
bought a big basket of durians and gave one to each
person.
When Brian first tasted the fruit, it was awful. The smell
was overpowering and made him almost throw up in
disgust. But out of respect for the boss, he forced himself
to swallow the awful-smelling durian.
The next year, durian season came again. Like the last
year, the whole team was brought to the site to eat the
fruit. Brian was nervous, but he ate the boss’s fruit. It still
smelled bad. The taste wasn’t like a fruit at all. But he was
able to swallow some of it without suffering too much.
The third year, he actually liked it. He even enjoyed the
taste. From then on, he gradually fell in love with the fruit.
After he returned home, he introduced durians to his wife,
kids, friends and relatives.
The family started eating durians every week. Brian’s wife
used to have stomach problems. But by eating durians
regularly, she said that her stomach became healthier than
ever.
It just goes to show you that sometimes you have to hold
your nose, take a deep breath and go for it. That’s what
Brian did, and he’s glad that he did. What at first appeared
to be a horrible, stinky fruit became an honoured guest in
Brian’s home.
To him and his family, the humble and misunderstood
durian is the king of fruits.

The Snowball Fight
My mom always says, “Don’t throw snowballs. You might
hurt someone, or get hurt yourself.” But it had been a long
time since we had snow, and I felt that lately she had told
me not to do a lot of things. So, I got mad.
“Oh Mom! You won’t let me do anything. You’re no fun!” I
said as I ran outside, slamming the door behind me.
I was playing in the snow with my friends, just building a
big snow fort. I was feeling bad about what I had said to
my mom. I was sorry that I had hurt her feelings.
Then, out of nowhere... Wham! A snowball hit me in the
head. It was not hard, but the whole back of my head was
covered in snow.
I turned around and saw that some kids in another snow
fort had launched an attack. They had a big kid with them
who could throw really far. I figured I’d better not throw
back or I would get into trouble. But just then, a big
snowball hit my friend’s jacket and exploded, covering my
face.
That was it... the battle was on. We all put on our
snowboarding goggles, covered our faces with scarves,
and we started throwing! I even got the new big kid right in
the face with a huge powdery explosion.
Then they attacked. They all came running with loads of
snow and came right into our fort. The big kid grabbed me
and playfully rubbed the snow on my face. We all laughed
and laughed. Then I got some snow and gave the big kid a
pile of snow on the head.
After a few minutes, they all started to walk away. I was
curious, so I said to the new kid, “Hey, what’s your name?”
His voice was muffled.
“Ah, you wouldn’t want to know my name,” he said. “I’m no
fun.”
“Huh?” I said. Then, the kid pulled off his scarf. What a
surprise! It was my mom!
I guess moms can be fun after all.

How to Fix a Mistake
Last week, I learned a really good lesson. Let me tell you
what happened.
My friend Allan and I were playing catch in my yard. We
were having fun throwing the ball back and forth. Then, I
threw the ball too hard and Allan missed his catch. The
ball hit my neighbour’s window. We heard the big sound.
Crash! Smash! The window broke into many pieces.
We were scared. We ran into my backyard, and hid. Mr.
Jones, the neighbour, came running out of his house and
looked around. He was trying to see who threw the ball.
We hid until Mr. Jones went back into his house.
Later, I saw that Mr. Jones had repaired the broken glass.
He was sitting outside. He waved at me. I felt ashamed as
I waved back at him. I knew what I should do, but I was
afraid to do it.
Later, my mom and I were talking. She told me about the
broken window. “Poor Mr. Jones,” she said. “He’s such a
nice guy. I can’t believe anyone would break his window
and not stay around to apologize.”
Right away, I knew what I had to do. I told Mom that I
broke the window by accident. I told her that I ran away.
Mom said I could easily fix that mistake. She said I should
go right over now and own up to my mistake. It wasn’t
easy, knocking on Mr. Jones’ door and telling him what I
had done.
Mr. Jones looked at me after I explained what happened.
He was not angry at all. I asked him how much it cost to
repair the window. I told him that I would save my money
and pay back every penny of it.
Mr. Jones smiled. “It’s not the money that matters,” he
said. “I was really hurt that someone would do that to me
without stopping to apologize. Now that you have come
and explained the accident, I feel good again.”

Handy Facts
Did you ever stop to take a look at some of the amazing
things we all sometimes take for granted? Like hands, for
instance.
Think about it. If we didn’t have hands, we would never
have been able to build the world we live in today. Have
you ever seen a dog type on a keyboard with its paws, or
a horse sew a pair of pants with its hooves?
Our hands, and how we use our fingers and thumbs,
make us very special. Here are some amazing facts about
the hands attached to the ends of our arms.
Fact 1: There are no muscles in your fingers. That’s right.
The muscles are in your palms and arms. Your fingers
have tendons. Tendons are like strings in the fingers that
actually control their movement -- almost like a puppet.
Fact 2: Your hand has about 29 major and minor bones,
29 major joints, and over 123 ligaments. There are 34
muscles in your arm and hand that allow your fingers to
move.
We’ve all pricked one of our fingers with a sharp point, and
it hurts. Why?
Fact 3: There are 48 nerves in your hand. Nerves are
small sensors that send signals to the brain when
something is wrong. No wonder it hurts when you prick
your finger! There are a lot of nerves there to send signals
to your brain.
What about your thumb? It’s controlled by nine muscles
and it’s the most important part of your hand. How
important? Well, two thousand years ago, Julius Caesar
ordered that the thumbs of captured warriors be cut off so
that they could not fight again. Even then, people realized
that thumbs were important.
In your brain, there is an area that controls all the
movement in the body. About one quarter of this part of
the brain is used just to control the muscles of the hands!
Fingernails are amazing too. They’re really just a type of
hair!
So, take a look at your hands. They are amazing tools. Be
careful with them because hand injuries are common. Be
good to your hands, and they’ll serve you for an entire
lifetime!

Planting for the Future
Jim Flinn and his family have been taking part in Earth
Day celebrations for as long as he can remember. Each
spring, the Flinn family puts down a few more roots.
This year, Jim decided to invite some of his classmates to
join the family planting trees on Earth Day.
“Did you know that each day, one mature tree produces
enough oxygen for four people to breathe?” Jim asked his
friends enthusiastically. Before anyone could respond, he
continued, “But that’s not all. Trees also remove the
harmful carbon dioxide that pollutes our air.”
According to Jim, what is good for the earth, is good for
everyone. “My parents have always encouraged me to be
good to the earth,” he explained to his classmates. “They
say that we should respect our planet and make sure that
it’s healthy.”
The Flinn family set aside the whole weekend for planting
trees. So did Jim’s friends.
When the trees arrived, the Flinns made sure they had
lots of water. Then, with shovels and pails, they headed
out to the field and started digging.
“First, make a big hole,” explained Jim, who knew what he
was doing after years of practice. “Make sure the roots will
fit into the hole. Put a little water in the bottom of the hole
and put your tree inside. Then, cover the roots and fill the
hole with dirt. And use your feet to pack it in well around
the new tree.”
You could tell that this young boy took pride in what he
and his family did each spring. “We don’t have to plant
hundreds of trees,” said Jim’s father. “Even if you can only
plant one tree each year, it will add up in the end. As the
saying goes, every little bit helps.”
After five hours of hard work, twenty trees were planted on
the site.
Seeing the new trees standing upright neatly, Jim’s friends
decided to join the event again next time.

Name That Place
Yellowknife, Whitehorse, Come By Chance, Nowhere and
Somewhere -- all are names of towns and cities in North
America. Ottawa, Beijing, Paris, Hanoi and Tokyo -- all are
important world cities. But how did they get these names?
And why?
Some names sound funny, and some of them make no
sense when you first hear them. But there is always a
story and a tradition behind a name. People settle in an
area. A city begins to grow. In the beginning, it might have
no name, but soon, people start calling it something.
When enough people use this name, it usually sticks. And
a new city name is born.
In the tradition of East Asia, important cities are given
names that tell us exactly what they are, and where they
are located. Nearly everyone will know that Beijing means
“northern capital”. But did you know that Tokyo and Hanoi
mean “eastern capital”?
Ottawa, Canada’s capital city, was given its name
thousands of years ago. It is located at a place where two
rivers meet, and was a place where Indian nations came
to trade with each other long ago.
In the native language, Adawe means “to trade”. When the
Europeans first settled in the area, they heard the Natives
calling the place Adawe. Said aloud, this sounded like
Ottawa to the European ear. Soon enough, everyone was
referring to the city as Ottawa.
When a European explorer arrived at a place in the far
northern region of Canada, he found Native people living
near the shores of Great Slave Lake. They carried huge
knives made of copper, which appeared yellow in the
shining sun. The explorer decided to call them
Yellowknives. He named the place where they lived,
Yellowknife. Today, it is Canada’s largest northern city.
Next time you hear an unusual city name, see if you can
discover how it got that name.

The North Star
Every summer, I get a special treat. I visit Grandpa for two
weeks. I always have fun and I always learn something
new.
My grandfather knows a lot about everything. One
summer, he showed me how to make a fire without using
matches. Another summer, he taught me the names of all
the wild flowers. And this summer, he showed me how to
find one special star. “If you can find this star,” Grandpa
said, “you will always know your way around.”
“What a great idea!” I thought. Maps and compasses can
tell you which way to go and how to get there. But what
happens if you’re lost and you don’t have a map or a
compass?
I was quite excited about it all. Grandfather got some
books and pointed out all the major constellations. He
explained how all the stars and planets in the sky change
places throughout the night. They even change places in
different seasons of the year. But there is one star that
always sits in the sky at precisely the same spot, no
matter what.
After reading about the Milky Way and learning a lot about
the night sky, Grandfather said it was time to go out and
take a look.
The night was dark. The sky was lit up with millions of
stars. Grandpa pointed to one group of stars called the Big
Dipper. “See it there,” said Grandpa. “It looks like a dipper
for drinking water. Follow a line from the edge of the
dipper. It leads to the North Star. The North Star always
points to the north. If you can find this star, you will always
know where you are. You will never be lost.”
It took a while to find it. But there it was -- the North Star!
Grandpa says it is always in the same place. My
grandfather shows me the most wonderful things. Now I
know how to find my way using only the stars as my
guide.

One Lucky Cat
One day, we were going on vacation. We left our cat
Oscar with my grandmother. It was a great vacation, but
we got some bad news when we returned home.
Grandma told us that Oscar had run away. Her dog Katie
chased Oscar away and he never came back.
We were all sad. This cat had been with us since he was
seven days old. He was part of the family. What could we
do? We posted signs around Grandma’s neighbourhood.
We even went door to door with pictures, but no one had
seen Oscar.
The winter came and went. Still no Oscar.
A whole year passed, and winter came again. It was a
winter even colder and longer than the last. Surely, no cat
could survive two winters outside! By that time, we had
stopped thinking about Oscar.
But one day, the phone rang. It was the animal hospital.
They had a cat with a tag that showed our home phone
number. Can you believe it? It was our Oscar! We could
not believe Oscar was still alive. We rushed to the animal
hospital. There he was -- after being lost for one and a half
years!
He was skinny and nervous, but he was alive. We were
overjoyed at our good luck.
It turned out that after he ran away from Grandma’s
house, he hid in a storage area at the end of town. Some
kids found Oscar and tried to catch him, but he was too
fast and too scared. He wouldn’t let them get close to him.
Winter came, and these kids left a little food there for
Oscar. They didn’t want the cat to starve. Even on the
coldest days, they didn’t forget to leave some food for
Oscar.
At the very end, Oscar was not afraid of these kids
anymore. The kids finally caught Oscar and took him to
the animal hospital.
These wonderful kids saved him. Our Oscar sure is one
lucky cat!

The Rain Kept Falling
(adapted from a Bible story)
Many long years ago, when the earth was young, people
had a good life. But slowly, they started to do bad things.
They fought, they stole, they lied, and they cheated.
God was not happy. So, he decided that the only thing to
do was to destroy everything and begin anew.
There was one good man named Noah. God came to him
and said, “I am going to bring a flood of water over all the
earth and drown everything that is here. You must build a
big boat. When it is ready, take two of each animal into
your boat -- one male and one female.”
Noah was a good man and did as he was told. He built a
large wooden boat. The people laughed at him. They
joked and made fun of Noah, saying, “Why are you
wasting your time with this boat? Have fun! Enjoy. Eat and
drink and do not worry about anything.”
But Noah kept building his boat. When it was finished, he
loaded two of each animal into the boat. Of every animal
on earth, he found two -- lions, tigers, horses, sheep, cows
and giraffes.
When the boat was filled with the animals, it began to rain.
It rained, and rained for days and weeks. The water rose
higher and higher all over the earth. There was nowhere
for the people who had been evil to escape.
Noah brought his family on the boat with the animals, and
they were safe. The boat rose with the water. Soon, water
was everywhere. It covered the highest mountains in the
Himalayas, and no one survived except for Noah, his
family, and the animals.
The boat floated all over the earth. Noah feared they
would never see dry land again. Then one day, he sent a
dove out to fly over the water. Soon, it came back with a
tree branch in its mouth. Noah knew that the waters were
going down. Otherwise, how could the dove find a tree?
Slowly, the water disappeared. Noah and his animals
came back onto the new earth, and life began again.
Humans were given a second chance to be good.
