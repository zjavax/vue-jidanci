    Skating on the Canal
    One year, after our New Year’s Eve family feast, we all
    made plans to do something special in the coming year.
    Dad had a really good one. He was going to learn ice
    skate, and he would begin first thing in the morning. He
    said that it was his dream for many years.
    There is a canal in our city. A canal is a man-made river
    where boats travel in summer. But in winter, it freezes over
    and becomes a wonderful outdoor skating rink. When Dad
    immigrated to Ottawa, he walked on the canal every
    winter and watched people, young and old, skate. He
    wondered how people were able to stand on the narrow
    metal skates on a slippery ice surface.
    He never thought he would learn to skate himself. He
    thought he was too old and might break a bone if he fell.
    But that New Year’s Day, Dad took the whole family to the
    canal.
    We helped him put on his skates. I showed him how to
    stand on the ice. My sister told him to keep his body low in
    case he fell. Dad learned like a young student, listening
    carefully to our instructions. Watching him walking like a
    toddler, my sister and I laughed.
    After the first ten minutes, Dad could stand on his skates.
    Thirty minutes later, he began to move across the ice
    slowly.
    We spent the rest of the day on the canal, having fun
    watching Dad skate. At the end of the day he could skate,
    but mostly on his left foot. He pushed himself forward with
    his right foot, gliding on his left foot through the fast-
    moving crowd of skaters.
    From that day on, Dad went skating more often than
    anyone else in our family. For the first few weeks, he could
    only glide on the one foot -- a funny skating style that
    made us laugh. By the time the mid-winter festival began,
    he had become a stable skater.
    Now, we spend a lot of time skating on the canal together.
    It’s a fun memory for our family.

    Growing Up
    This year we have a new teacher and she’s a lot of fun to
    be around. She has many new ideas and the kids really
    like her. So I guess we shouldn’t have been surprised
    when she told us that we would be volunteering at a home
    for older people one afternoon.
    Some of us kids were a little uncomfortable about this. I
    think we weren’t sure what to expect. Most of us had
    grandparents, but being around a lot of older people was
    something new to us. What would we talk about with these
    old folks?
    “I know some of you are thinking that you don’t have
    anything in common with older people, so I have asked
    one of the people from the home to come and talk to you
    today,” our teacher said.
    And in walked an old man. He looked around the room
    and asked with a smile, “At what age do you think you are
    grown up?”
    The kids answered different ages, from 18 to 40, and
    everything in between.
    “You know what age I say? I say never!” said the old man.
    “No one is ever fully grown up. I’m still growing up, even
    today. I keep learning new things. I keep learning how to
    make up for mistakes that I’ve made, and how to treat
    people better.
    “When I was 20, I thought I was a grown-up. When I was
    30, I thought 20 seemed very young. When I was 40, I
    thought I knew everything... And at 50, I thought I had
    done everything. When I turned 60, I started to get used to
    the idea of being old. At 70, I was thankful for my health.
    And now, at 80, I’m thankful for every day that I have.
    “I’m still growing, and one day, I hope to be a real grown-
    up! But until then, I still like being a kid. That’s how you
    stay young.”
    We all loved listening to him talk. We couldn’t wait to visit
    the home for older people. We felt that we had grown up a
    little that day... but not much!

    Canadian Weather
    Canada and cold are synonymous in many people’s
    minds. Many people believe that Canada is a cold and
    barren wasteland.
    Nothing could be further from the truth. For the most part,
    this huge land mass has what is known as a temperate
    climate -- not too hot, and not too cold. In most aspects,
    Canadian weather is similar to that of other nations in the
    northern hemisphere, especially those in northern Europe.
    But there are a couple of exceptions.
    In British Columbia, it rains nearly every day during winter.
    It snows only one or two days per year. Temperatures
    rarely fall below 0°C.
    The Arctic regions are a completely different story. When
    temperatures drop to -40°C, things get extremely
    dangerous. Death by exposure to the cold is not common,
    but it does occur every year in the Arctic.
    Wind chill -- an occurrence when howling winds cause the
    air to feel colder than the actual temperature -- is a
    common word in the Canadian vocabulary. So is frostbite.
    Every Canadian child is taught to recognize frostbite, a
    condition that sets in when skin is exposed to extreme
    cold for too long. The toes, fingers or face begin to tingle
    and burn. Living with Canadian winter weather requires
    common sense and proper winter gear.
    But on a typical winter day, you’re more likely to see the
    sun high and bright. If properly dressed, it’s possible to
    stay comfortable outdoors all day.
    So yes, Canada is cold in winter. And it’s hot in summer. In
    spring and fall, it’s gloriously temperate.
    The record for the coldest day in North America is held by
    a Canadian Yukon town called Snag. That temperature
    was -63°C. And two towns in the prairies hold the record
    for the warmest day in Canada: +45°C.

    History of the Computer
    Close your eyes and imagine two huge rooms.
    Now imagine some massive fans and an air conditioner
    running noisily in the background, and people in white lab
    coats running from one glowing tube to another. A print-out
    provides information from one end of the strange-looking
    device occupying most of the room. Is it science fiction? A
    scary movie?
    Welcome to computers -- 1940s style! ENIAC, the first
    electronic mainframe computer, weighed more than 30
    tons and was larger than a modem house. It covered 167
    square metres and needed 160 kilowatts of electrical
    power. When it was turned on, it caused the city of
    Philadelphia to go dark for a moment. This “modern
    computer” was 1,000 times faster than any other
    calculating machine of its era and could complete 5,000
    additions, 357 multiplications or 38 divisions in one
    second. Fast? Yes, but imagine trying to carry it to the
    nearest Internet cafe!
    Size matters. And in the world of computers, the goal has
    always been to make them more powerful and, at the
    same time, smaller. Think about laptops, cellphones and
    video games. Each of these owes its existence to ENIAC.
    Integrated circuits and the silicone chip made computer
    operations faster and allowed for even smaller machines.
    In no time at all, the power of the computer reached the
    point where e-mail and the World Wide Web became
    realistic and possible.
    It’s difficult to imagine a world without e-mail or the
    Internet. However, not long ago, the word “computer”
    conjured up images of massive mainframe devices
    operating as if by magic. When the first personal computer
    was introduced to the world in 1981, few people could
    imagine the changes it would bring.
    Next time you log on to your e-mail account or check
    some information on the Internet, think of ENIAC, and
    imagine what the world would be like if all computers were
    just as huge.
    Imagine having to call a tow truck to transport your
    computer to your friend’s house for a night of surfing the
    Web!

    A Day Without Technology (I)
    When Joan Wilton looked out the window, all she was the
    ice from the freezing rain slowly building up on everything.
    The tree branches were all bent with a beautiful layer of
    heavy ice wrapped around them. The thermometer should
    have been well below zero, but the cold of winter had not
    arrived in Canada as it usually does by this time of year.
    For two days, the Wiltons had been listening to radio
    reports about the build-up of ice and the dangers it might
    cause if it continued. Already, the trees were heavy with
    the load of ice they were bearing. On some trees, the
    branches were so heavy that they touched the ground and
    threatened to break off. It was a beautiful winter scene, but
    it was very dangerous.
    Joan Wilton’s two young children, Rob and Tammy, had
    not gone to school that morning. The roads were covered
    with a one-inch layer of ice, making driving dangerous.
    Everything was coming to a halt. Their father had called
    that morning to tell them that he had arrived safely at
    work, but that the roads were now closed and he might not
    be able to get home that evening.
    Suddenly, there was a crashing sound outside. Then,
    another. Mrs. Wilton looked out the window in time to see
    the giant maple tree in the front yard come falling down. At
    the same time, the television flickered and went dead. She
    called her children, who were playing video games in the
    next room. They came running into the kitchen
    complaining that the power had failed.
    They all stood listening as branches crashed to the ground
    outside. Mrs. Wilton tried the telephone. She wanted to
    call her husband to see if the power was out in the city, but
    when she picked up the phone, there was nothing but
    silence at the other end.
    She didn’t panic, but she knew that it was going to be a
    long and strange day. She knew that they must take care
    of each other and wait to see how things would turn out.
    The best thing they could do was to remain calm and stay
    safe.
    12-6
    A Day Without Technology (II)
    As the children helped their mother prepare for the coming
    night, they were amazed at how much a power outage
    could affect everything in their lives. The refrigerator,
    stove, television, computer and lights all stopped the
    moment the electricity went out.
    With no electricity, the family might have been helpless.
    But the Wiltons lived in the country and were prepared for
    life without technology. As Mr. Wilton used to say, “We are
    tied to technology in this modern world, but we do not
    have to be slaves to it.”
    As the night closed in, Mrs. Wilton and her two children
    sat in the dark kitchen. They had candles for light. Since
    the oil furnace did not work without electricity, the Wiltons
    were glad their father had installed a small wood stove in
    their living room. The warm air from the stove filled the
    house as their dinner -- a big pot of soup with bread and
    cheese-- warmed up on top of it.
    Radios and television didn’t work in power outages. But
    the Wiltons had a battery-powered transistor radio. It was
    their only way to connect to the outside world. It was tuned
    in to the nearest news channel, which was broadcasting
    news about the massive ice storm.
    To their surprise, the ice storm had shut down everything
    in the province. All over Ontario and Quebec, families
    were left without electricity-- no radios, no telephones and
    no heat. Many of them were desperate.
    The Wilton children sat with their mother in the still night.
    The family began to play a game. It seemed like a good
    way to pass the time. They laughed and joked as they
    took turns acting out simple scenes for which the others
    had to guess the meaning.
    Later in the evening, they went outside and marveled at
    the beauty of the night sky. As they stood looking up at the
    sky, they realized how lucky they were. They were
    prepared for the emergency. They could easily live without
    technology for a day or two.

    The Three Dreams
    There were three young girls who lived in a small town.
    They were best friends. Each girl had a dream about her
    future. The girl whose family was rich said that she would
    never be happy until she was beautiful. The second girl
    was beautiful, but she said that she would not be happy
    until she was rich. The third girl, who was plain and quite
    poor, said that she was happy now, even though she had
    nothing. But she said she would be happier if all the
    people around her were happy. The other two laughed at
    the girl for her simple way of thinking.
    The three took separate roads to pursue their dreams. The
    first two girls went to big cities, trying to find happiness.
    The third girl spent her twenties in the little town, helping
    children with disabilities. She met a nice man, and they
    soon married. They had many children. And together they
    worked with disabled kids.
    Years later, the girl received a call from her old friends,
    whom she had not seen for many years. She wanted to
    hear all about their lives.
    When they met, the rich girl had so much makeup on that
    it was hard to recognize her. She explained that she had
    surgery on her face to make her beautiful, but the surgery
    had left scars. She was terribly unhappy.
    The second girl, who was very beautiful, had married a
    wealthy man. But he lost all his money in the financial
    crisis. So she left him and now she was alone and
    unhappy.
    When the third girl told them about her simple life, the
    other two began to cry. They recalled that she had not
    wished for anything. They were envious and embarrassed,
    for they had laughed at her because she lacked big
    dreams.
    The third girl was not only smart, but also very kind. She
    helped them learn to be happy with what they had.
    They spent the rest of their lives as friends, always
    remembering that happiness does not come from the
    outside, but rather from somewhere deep inside a
    person’s heart.

    A World of Amazement
    There is a loud noise coming from the top of the
    auditorium hall at St. Paul High School. Students are
    screaming, clapping and laughing. What’s going on? It’s a
    science show being presented by Professor LeBlanc from
    a prestigious university.
    Two volunteers are called up to the front. The professor
    hands them each a metal hemisphere with a handle. He
    then lines up the two hemispheres, edge to edge, making
    one complete metal sphere. On one of the half spheres,
    there is a valve. His assistant connects the valve to a
    pump and turns the pump on for a few seconds to get the
    air out of the ball. Then, he turns off the valve.
    The two volunteers are asked to pull the two halves to
    separate them. Cheered on by the crowd, the two
    students try as hard as they can, but the ball will not
    separate. More students are added to each side. The
    sound of cheers becomes even louder. The two sides pull
    and pull, like in a tug of war, but still they have no success.
    “This demonstration,” the professor explains, “shows how
    much air pressure is acting on us all the time. Think about
    that. Isn’t it amazing?”
    Then, the professor starts his “Cold War” show. Holding a
    celery stem and a few carrots, he dips the vegetables into
    some liquid nitrogen. Nitrogen is in our air all the time as a
    gas. But when its temperature drops to -200°C, it
    becomes liquid. When the professor takes the vegetables
    out of the liquid, he smashes them on the floor. The
    vegetables break into small pieces with little bits flying
    everywhere! The liquid nitrogen makes the vegetables
    fragile like glass.
    As the demonstration continues, the show becomes even
    more exciting. He chills his audience with a -78°C blizzard.
    He transforms soggy frozen cigars into torches and he
    fires electromagnetic cannons that shoot smoke rings at
    the audience.
    The crowd goes wild. “That’s cool!” one kid yells. “I wish
    my parents had come to the show,” shouts another. The
    students really enjoy the show and they are eager to learn
    more about physics.
    12-9
    The Lions and the Hyenas
    Abu was a man who knew everything about lions and
    hyenas. He had lived with them and hunted them for
    years. Now, he worked to help save them. He came to our
    school to tell us about them.
    Abu explained that among some animals, the females are
    in charge. The female lions live together in groups called
    “prides” and raise young lions. The male lions, once they
    become adults, move out and live on their own.
    Life in the wild can be difficult. Often, there is a limited
    supply of food. Lions have to compete with their most-
    hated enemies, hyenas. When a pride kills an antelope or
    a water buffalo, the only thing that can drive off the lions is
    a large group of hyenas.
    Normally, a fight between a lion and a hyena would not be
    a fair fight because lions are so big and powerful. But
    hyenas live in large packs and often outnumber the lions
    as they hunt and feed.
    Abu said, “I knew one huge male lion named Rex, which
    means king. One time, a huge hyena pack came close to
    the female lions and their babies. It was many hyenas
    against only a few lions and their cubs. It didn’t look good
    as the hyenas attacked, but Rex suddenly showed up out
    of nowhere. He courageously fought the hyenas himself,
    killing them one by one.
    “Those he did not kill, he drove them off with loud,
    ferocious roars,” Abu continued. “The lions and hyenas
    fight each other for the same food all the time. Sometimes,
    the lions win and sometimes the hyenas drive off the lions.
    But, there are always battles.
    “So, be grateful next time you pull your sandwich out of
    your lunchbox that you don’t have to fight a pack of hungry
    hyenas for it!”
    We all laughed. I would like to travel to Africa one day and
    get a close look at those lions and hyenas. But not too
    close!
    12-10
    The Angry Chihuahua (I)
    Let’s get something straight right off the top. I’m not
    exactly the biggest guy on my hockey team. I’m not even
    in the top half of the team in height. Okay, the truth is that
    I’m not only the smallest player on my team, but also the
    smallest in the league.
    So what? Does this mean I can’t handle the puck as well
    as the big guys who are over six feet tall? Does it mean
    that I can’t set up perfect goals and make laser-straight
    passes? No, I can do all those things. But here is the
    problem: I weigh about half as much as most of the
    teenagers in my league. Think about that-- half as much!
    It means these guys can hold me off using just one arm.
    When I try to get at the puck on the ice, they simply push
    me away. I suppose I shouldn’t be on the team. However,
    there is one reason that I made the team. Although my
    arms and legs are short and my body is small, I know that
    I can match anyone out there in the size of my heart.
    Hockey is a fast game. It’s like soccer, except it takes
    place on the ice and you use skates, sticks and a puck
    instead of a soccer ball.
    My coach calls me the “Angry Chihuahua”. You’re
    probably wondering why I was given such a weird name.
    The first time my coach called me that, I didn’t like it at all.
    I mean, who wants to be named after a small Mexican
    dog?
    But later, I realized that it was a compliment. One time, I
    was trying to get the puck from a huge player from the
    other team. I couldn’t get at the puck from one direction,
    so I kept switching from one side of the player to the other
    side.
    I guess that was quite a funny sight because when I got
    back to the bench, the coach said I looked like an angry
    Chihuahua. I didn’t like it, but that’s how I got the name.
    Something happened a few days later, and now, I wear
    this name with pride.
    12-11
    The Angry Chihuahua (II)
    The team laughed the first time the coach called me the
    Angry Chihuahua. I pretended to laugh, but inside I was
    hurt. I felt sorry for myself. One player who didn’t laugh
    was Eric. He always went out of his way to make me feel
    at home on the team. Except for Eric, I felt like the whole
    team thought I was a joke!
    A week later, we were playing against another team. They
    were all huge, and they played very hard and rough. One
    of their players was the biggest bully in the league.
    Although there is no fighting allowed in my league, I knew
    that one big hit from this guy could leave me seriously
    injured.
    In the middle of the game, I was skating with the puck and
    I passed it to my winger, Eric. He was about to take a shot
    when the big bully on the other team took his stick and
    slashed Eric across the back of the leg. Eric dropped like
    a stone on the ice and writhed in agony.
    Then, the strangest thing happened. I saw the bully
    laughing, and I just couldn’t take it! I dashed towards him,
    yelling at him at the top of my lungs. He turned around
    and pushed me. I went flying backwards, sliding along the
    ice.
    I hit the ice so hard that I couldn’t breathe. But when I
    looked up, my teammates had all come over to pull him off
    me. They all looked at me and then at the big bully, who
    was no longer smiling. They shoved him away and the
    referee gave him a ten-game suspension.
    From that moment on, my teammates always treated me
    with the greatest respect. I think they were shocked to see
    that someone so small would dare to stand up to such a
    huge bully.
    Since then, I’ve learned to control my emotions, but
    everyone in the league heard the story. They all know that
    although I may be small, I don’t give up. I guess it’s not so
    bad being known as the Angry Chihuahua after all.
    12-12
    Friendship
    (based on a traditional story)
    Friendship is one of the most precious things in the world.
    If you look, you can find hundreds of stories about it. But
    how do you gain a good, lasting friendship? My father
    recently told me two stories about friendship.
    One day, two good friends were walking in the woods.
    Suddenly, a big black bear appeared and made a loud and
    threatening growl. One of the friends ran to the nearest
    tree and climbed to safety on a branch. The other friend
    lay down on the ground and did not move. He lay very still
    while the bear smelled him. It was scary, but still, he did
    not move. He pretended to be dead. Soon, the bear grew
    tired and walked back into the woods.
    His friend came down from the tree and asked, “What did
    the bear say to you when he was sniffing your ear?”
    The boy replied, “He whispered that I should never trust a
    friend who runs away at the first sign of danger.”
    “The point is,” my father said, “choose your friends wisely.”
    Then he told me another story.
    One day, as two friends walked along, they had an
    argument. One friend slapped the other. The boy then
    wrote this in the sand: My best friend slapped my face
    today.
    They continued on their way, arriving finally at a small
    lake. They went for a swim. The friend who had been
    slapped got stuck in the mud and was about to drown. The
    other friend, the one who had done the slapping, saved
    him.
    The boy who was saved wrote this on a stone: My best
    friend saved my life today.
    His friend said, “When I hit you, you wrote your words in
    the sand. When I saved you, you wrote them on the stone.
    Why?”
    The boy explained, “When a friend hurts you, write it in
    sand so that the winds of forgiveness will blow them away
    in time. But, when a friend is good to you, carve it in stone
    so that it will never disappear.”
    “The second point,” my father said, “is forgiveness and
    gratitude.”
    12-13
    Magnets: Seeing Is Believing
    There are many things in the world that we cannot see,
    feel, hear or touch. Think of wind, for example. On a windy
    day, we can see trees moving as the wind strikes them.
    But if someone asked you to take hold of some wind, you
    would not be able to do it. You can feel the effects of a
    cold winter wind, but you cannot reach out and grab a
    piece of that wind.
    It’s the same with the earth’s magnetic field. It has no
    sound. It’s invisible. Nothing you do will let you touch it.
    But it surrounds the earth, and it’s an important part of our
    everyday lives.
    Deep in the centre of the earth, there is a super hot liquid.
    As it moves around, it develops magnetism, which
    surrounds the earth with a powerful magnetic field. The
    earth’s magnetic field plays an important role in our
    survival. If it did not exist, the sun’s radiation would easily
    burn us.
    While you cannot see the magnetic field, it’s possible to
    see its effects. Magnets are special objects with a
    magnetic field surrounding them. All magnets have a north
    pole and a south pole. Energy leaves a magnet from the
    north pole and enters it from the south pole, just like it
    does on the earth.
    Magnets attract certain kinds of metals to them. Perhaps
    you have some papers stuck to your refrigerator with a
    magnet. How does it work? The refrigerator is made of
    metal, and the magnet tries to pull this metal towards
    itself. This pulling force holds the paper to the fridge by the
    power of magnetism.
    Perhaps you’ve seen a compass. This simple instrument
    was used long ago to help sailors determine the direction
    in which they were travelling. How does it work? A needle
    on top of the compass is drawn to the magnetic pull of the
    earth’s North Pole. No matter how you hold the compass,
    the needle always points north.
    There are many ways in which we can see the effects of
    magnetism. But as with wind and many forces of nature,
    we cannot touch, feel, hear or see it.

    A Letter to Santa Claus
    Writing was one of my favourite classes in school. My
    teacher said I had some skills as a writer, so she asked
    me to help some kindergarten students write letters to
    Santa Claus. I asked the teacher, “Why? Santa won’t
    answer them. What’s the point?” She told me that it was a
    good lesson in writing. So I agreed to help.
    We finished writing the letters. The next part of the project
    was to go as a class to the post office and deliver them.
    We gave the letters to the man there, and he smiled
    pleasantly. I was the last one to leave, and just as I was
    going out the door, the postman’s reading glasses fell out
    of his pocket. I picked them up. They were broken. He
    said, “That’s okay. I’ll just put some tape on them.”
    I held them as he taped them up, and then I ran to catch
    up with the kids.
    About a week later, the kindergarten teacher came to me
    and said, “Guess what? Santa is in my classroom!” I knew
    it was just someone dressed up as Santa, but he handed
    out letters to each little kid by name. Santa had received
    the letters and answered them. It was great fun to watch
    each kid read a letter from Santa.
    I walked up to Santa to thank him before he left. When I
    did, I noticed that his reading glasses had tape on them. It
    was the post office man! That man, who worked hard at
    the post office, took time from his busy life to answer those
    letters and make the kids feel good.
    It made the day feel a whole lot more like Christmas for
    me. The post office worker had the true spirit of Christmas.
    And he taught me a good lesson: a little kindness goes a
    long way.

    The Travelling Musician
    A long time ago, there was a musician who travelled from
    town to town making money by playing his music. It was a
    time of great poverty, and musicians were considered
    beggars.
    One day, the musician came to a little town. A sign on a
    post read, “No beggars and no musicians.” He thought, “I
    can’t go any farther. I’m so hungry, I can barely walk.”
    He decided to hide his violin, clean up as much as
    possible and pretend to be a regular person looking for
    work. He went from place to place and finally found a rich
    man who needed a ditch dug. It was terrible work, but the
    musician needed to eat.
    As he dug the ditch, he realized that he didn’t know how to
    do it correctly. Then, he heard a young girl playing a violin.
    It sounded awful. He could not stand it any longer, so he
    called to the girl, “Hello there. I’ve been listening to you
    playing
    “Oh,” the girl laughed. “I feel sorry for you! I’m terrible!”
    “I’m not a musician, but perhaps I could show you a
    couple of things,” he said. He picked up the beautiful violin
    and played a wonderful song. Soon, the girl’s parents
    came out.
    “I thought you were a ditch digger!” cried the rich man.
    “But you are a musician!”
    “Oh no, I am a ditch digger!” the musician lied.
    The rich man grabbed the musician’s hands. He turned
    them over and saw that they were smooth and had long
    graceful fingers. He knew those hands had never held a
    shovel before.
    “This is a terrible ditch. You’re fired!” the man said.
    Depressed, the musician started to walk away, but the rich
    man called out, “Perhaps we could use a violin player and
    music teacher.”
    The musician ran back and said, “I think I know just the
    person.”
    “Come with me, ditch digger. I’ll show you how to dig a
    ditch, and you show me how to play a violin!”
    From that day on, musicians were welcome in the little
    town.

    Knives, Forks, and Chopsticks (I)
    There are many ways to eat food. Every culture has a
    distinct way of eating.
    In parts of Africa, families and friends eat from a
    communal dish, dipping pieces of hard bread into the dish
    to grasp the food and get it from the bowl to their mouths.
    North Americans and Europeans use forks, knives, and
    spoons to accomplish the same task. In Asia, chopsticks
    are the utensil of choice.
    You might think it’s easy to use chopsticks, but I can
    assure you that it’s not as simple as it first appears. I
    learned this lesson a couple of years ago.
    I had applied for a job with a Chinese-Canadian company
    in Vancouver. As you know, the Chinese are famous for
    their food. They cook delicious food and they derive a
    simple pleasure from eating.
    So I was not surprised when my new boss invited me out
    to lunch to celebrate my new job. He said we were going
    to eat in a Chinese restaurant in Chinatown. I was
    nervous. I knew we would be using chopsticks, and while I
    had tried many times to master the technique, I had failed
    miserably in every attempt. How would I be able to make a
    good impression? Would they laugh at me? Would I make
    a complete fool of myself?
    I went home that evening and cooked some rice and
    chicken in a stir-fry. I heaped the food on my plate, and I
    spent the next hour attempting to learn how to use
    chopsticks. Try as I might, I could not hold the food with
    my chopsticks.
    I called a friend and asked her to explain exactly how to
    use the chopsticks. She patiently explained the proper
    way of holding them between the thumb, first and middle
    fingers. “It’s not that hard,” she said. “That’s easy for you
    to say,” I replied. “You’ve been eating with chopsticks all
    your life. It’s natural for you!”
    I didn’t get much sleep that evening. I tossed and turned in
    bed, worrying about lunch the next day.
    12-17
    Knives, Forks, and Chopsticks (II)
    The next day, I could hardly contain my anxiety. It was
    difficult to get any work done in the morning. At noon, I left
    with my boss and two co-workers and headed to the
    restaurant.
    We were seated at an excellent table. My boss wrote out
    the food order, speaking to the server in Mandarin. My
    heart was pounding, but then I noticed a strange thing.
    Instead of the customary chopsticks, each of us had
    knives, forks, and spoons.
    I was confused at first, but then, it hit me. My boss knew
    that I would have trouble with the chopsticks. He wanted
    to save me from embarrassment, so he had called ahead
    and arranged for us to be served with knives and forks. I
    couldn’t believe how thoughtful he was.
    In an instant, I made up my mind. I asked the server to
    bring some chopsticks for me. When they arrived, I took
    them in my hand and carefully manoeuvred my fingers
    around them.
    I looked over at my boss. He smiled as I grasped the
    chopsticks and took hold of a bit of rice and meat, holding
    on tightly as I tried to get it to my mouth. My fingers
    slipped and the food fell back to the plate. However, I
    didn’t give up, and eventually managed to eat my entire
    meal using only chopsticks. It felt like a great
    accomplishment.
    In the end, I wasn’t embarrassed at all. I’m glad my new
    boss was so considerate. And I’m really glad I decided to
    ask for chopsticks.
    We go out for lunch often in this new company. We always
    have a good laugh about that day.
    I have now mastered the chopstick technique. And you
    know, it really isn’t that difficult once you get used to it.

    History of Time
    Long ago, humans lived a nomadic life, wandering from
    place to place. When the sun came up, people began to
    gather food. When the sun went down, they went to sleep
    for the night.
    All of that changed once they began to settle and develop
    towns. At this point, they needed a way to tell time. This is
    when the first useful time-telling tool was invented: the
    sundial. As the sun travelled across the sky, it cast
    shadows on the face of the sundial. Using these shadow
    marks, it was possible to get a general idea of the time of
    the day.
    The hourglass was another basic time-telling tool. It
    consisted of two glass containers connected by a narrow
    glass tube. As sand flowed from the top glass container
    through the narrow neck to the bottom glass container, it
    was possible to get a general idea of the time.
    Different types of water clocks were invented next. A
    measured substance (this time, water) flowed out of one
    container into another container. When all of the water had
    flowed into the second container, people would know that
    a specific amount of time had passed.
    In the 11th century, mechanical clocks were invented, but
    they weren’t very accurate. They lost fifteen minutes each
    day. Mechanical clocks became more accurate when
    small springs were added to move the hands of the clock.
    As a result of this invention, clocks became smaller and
    for the first time, watches were built using this spring
    system.
    Over the next 300 years, many improvements were made
    to clocks. Mass production made them increasingly
    cheaper. Soon many people could afford a clock or watch.
    By the 1950s, digital watches were invented. The
    measurement of time had entered the modern age.
    In1967, the atomic clock was developed. In 1999, further
    improvements were made. The atomic clock is now
    accurate to within one second every twenty million years.
    An early caveman looked up at the sun to get a general
    idea of the time of day. Physicists in the 21st century use
    atomic clocks to assist them with important experiments.
    The history of time is indeed the history of human
    advancement.

    The Lucky Mistake
    My older sister is a runner. She has always loved to run.
    She runs the 10-kilometre race. She’s a great runner. She
    used to be a pretty good sprinter, but one day all of that
    changed because of a little mistake she made.
    She went to practice early in the morning. She was about
    to take off her running shoes, when she realized she had
    forgotten her sprinting shoes. Sprinting shoes are special
    because they’re small, light and have spikes on the
    bottom.
    When her coach found out that she had forgotten her
    sprinting shoes, he got mad. As a punishment, he ordered
    her to run laps around the track. So, off she went. Soon,
    she was running with other people who were on their long-
    distance practice runs.
    The runners were moving fast. It surprised the coach to
    see that this girl could keep up. The long-distance coach
    asked the sprinting coach, “Who is that?”
    “That’s one of my sprinters,” he said. The two coaches
    were shocked to see the group of runners coming around
    the final corner with my sister in the lead!
    Another girl was close to her for a while, but because of
    her sprinting ability, my sister seemed to just pull away
    from her. Her first time running a long-distance race and
    she came in first! The two coaches approached my sister.
    They were about to congratulate her when they looked
    down and realized she wasn’t wearing any shoes!
    “Well, you told me to run and I thought you meant right
    away, so I just got up and ran,” she explained. “I can’t
    believe how comfortable it is to run without my feet stuffed
    inside those little sprinting shoes.”
    From that moment on, my sister’s sprinting days were
    over. She was a natural long-distance runner. She works
    hard and hopes to go to the Olympics one day. Who
    knows what might happen?
    Who would have guessed that a little mistake would take
    my sister from being a good sprinter to being a great long-
    distance runner?

    Where Is the Cellphone?
    Dad was on his way home on an airplane. He was excited
    because he would be home with his family soon.
    The pilot announced that the landing would begin in ten
    minutes. Dad was in the last row of seats on the plane. He
    buckled the seat belt, put his cellphone on the empty seat
    next to him and got ready for the landing.
    The plane was getting lower and lower. Then it touched
    the ground, shaking violently. After gliding on the runway
    for a while, it finally stopped.
    People started to get their carry-on luggage. Dad reached
    out for his cellphone on the seat beside him, but it wasn’t
    there anymore! He was sure that he left it on the seat. Had
    someone stolen it?
    Dad was anxious. He searched everywhere. He looked on
    the floor. He checked all his pockets. He checked the seat
    pocket in front of him. But still, he could not find his
    cellphone. It had mysteriously disappeared!
    Dad was getting really nervous. His cellphone had all his
    contacts. He did not want to lose all of that information.
    A flight attendant noticed that Dad was looking for
    something. “What are you looking for?” she asked.
    “My cellphone,” Dad answered as he continued to search.
    The attendant used the microphone to ask the passengers
    to help.
    Just then, a passenger at the front of the airplane called
    out, “Hey! There’s a cellphone at my feet.”
    It turned out that Dad’s cellphone flew off the seat during
    the shaky landing. It fell on the floor and slid from the back
    of the airplane to the front.
    Dad was happy that he found his cellphone. He kept
    saying, “Thank you, thank you very much!”
    Later, when he was home, he said, “Imagine how much
    force there is when a plane is landing. No wonder
    everyone has to use a seatbelt.” Then, he smiled and said,
    “My cellphone should do the same!”

    Perfume for Mom
    My dad hates shopping. I’m his only daughter, so he
    counts on me to help him choose my mom’s birthday gifts.
    A few days ago, we went to some stores to buy some
    perfume as a gift for Mom. But we couldn’t find a good
    one. On the way out, we walked by the men’s counter and
    noticed a really nice men’s cologne.
    I said to my dad, “It’s too bad that this cologne is for men
    because it smells great and Mom would love it!” Suddenly,
    I realized that we had been shopping for a long time and I
    had to go to work. I said goodbye to my father and told
    him, “Just keep looking, Dad, and you’ll find one.”
    That night at her birthday party, my dad gave my mom her
    perfume. She loved it! Everyone was having fun. My Uncle
    Ted is a large man. He and his wife were standing near
    my parents. My mom and dad suddenly noticed that his
    cologne smelled familiar.
    Uncle Ted said very loudly, “Hey, you’re wearing the same
    cologne as me!” My mom was a little shocked and
    embarrassed.
    Then, Uncle Ted’s wife said that Ted’s cologne was called
    “Summer Time”. She then asked what my mom’s perfume
    was called. Mom replied, “I don’t know. It came in a fancy
    sprayer bottle.” She glared at my dad. He had a look of
    panic on his face.
    After the party, my dad confessed. “I bought men’s
    perfume and a fancy sprayer, and then I put the perfume
    in the sprayer bottle.”
    My mom has a good sense of humour, so she knew she
    could tease him. “So you think a man’s cologne suits me
    better than a lady’s perfume?” she said with a smile,
    winking at me as she said it.
    My poor dad didn’t know what to say. “Uh, no... Well, it...”
    he stammered. My mom laughed, but it made me think.
    Who’s to say what scent is for men or for women? If it
    smells nice, it smells nice.
    As for the perfume my dad bought for my mom, they
    solved that problem. They both wear it!

    Seven Generations - in the Future
    My father told me that there used to be a forest near our
    town. But the farmer who owned the forest cut down trees
    every year until one year, there were no trees left.
    One day, our teacher took us on a class picnic. We sat in
    the field where the forest used to be, and we talked about
    how there used to be a beautiful forest there.
    In Canada, we used to call Native people “Indians”, but
    now we use the more respectful words, “Aboriginal
    people”. One of the children in my class comes from a
    tribe that lived on the Western Plains. His name is John.
    He said, “It makes me really sad to see a forest cut down.
    My people have taught me to always think seven
    generations ahead. That way, you will never do anything
    to the land that will hurt it in the future.”
    We all talked about what John had said, and our teacher
    came up with a great idea.
    “Let’s go buy seeds and plant some trees!” she said. “We
    won’t be able to buy many, but it will be a good start!”
    So that’s what we did. For the rest of the spring, we
    worked hard planting small trees and seeds. We planted
    thousands of seeds and hundreds of small trees.
    That was five years ago. Now, when I stand in that field
    that was once empty, I see trees about as high as I am.
    We named the forest “The Aboriginal Forest”. Every year,
    John’s uncle comes and does a special ceremony to bless
    the forest.
    It’s great to see how we’ve changed the field. It taught us
    the power of thinking about the future.

    Skating on History
    Every year, an amazing thing happens right in the middle
    of the city of Ottawa. What is it? North America’s oldest
    operating canal becomes the world’s longest outdoor
    skating rink.
    When I’m out there skating, I often think of the man who
    built this canal more than 150 years ago. His name was
    Colonel By.
    In 1812, there was a war between the United States and
    Canada. When the war ended, Canadians were afraid of
    another attack. They wanted a secure way to get supplies
    from Montreal to the central part of Canada. Although
    there were many lakes and rivers in the region, they were
    not connected.
    After much study, the people decided to build a series of
    canals to join the lakes and rivers. It was a huge
    engineering problem. The government hired Colonel By,
    and work began in 1826. There were many obstacles, and
    many people felt that the job of building the canal was
    impossible.
    But Colonel By took up the challenge. For six years, he
    worked hard. He accomplished many great engineering
    feats for this time in history. The land was not level, so he
    had to build 46 locks to raise and lower boats. He also had
    to build 24 dams to hold water back. At the time, one of
    these dams was the highest dam in the world.
    Thousands of workers were injured or killed during
    construction. The government did not plan for enough
    money to build the canal. But the Colonel kept on building.
    In 1832, the canal was completed, and Colonel By made
    the first trip from end to end.
    However, because he had gone over budget, he was
    recalled to England. Even though the government had not
    provided enough money to build the canal, Colonel By
    was held responsible. He was disgraced and died a few
    years later.
    But in the end, the Colonel got the last laugh. Today, the
    canal that he built against all odds is a United Nations
    World Heritage site, and his name is honoured throughout
    Canada.

    Birds of the World
    Birds are really interesting. They come in all shapes and
    sizes, and they’re found everywhere. There are nearly two
    billion adult birds on the planet. That’s more than any
    other kind of animal.
    Can you guess what the most common bird on the planet
    is? It’s not hard if you really think about it. Here’s a hint:
    humans everywhere love to eat this bird. That’s right:
    chickens. There are more chickens than any other kind of
    bird!
    When it comes to deciding on the biggest bird on Earth,
    things get a little more complicated. Is the question which
    is the heaviest, which is the tallest, or which has the
    largest wingspan?
    Things get even more complicated when you realize that
    not all birds fly. But all birds have wings. The world’s
    largest bird is the ostrich. It has wings, but it can’t fly. It’s
    about 3 metres tall and weighs about 160 kilograms. Of
    the birds that can fly, the largest species lives in Africa. Its
    name is the Kori Bustard. It can weigh up to 20 kilograms.
    The smallest bird is the hummingbird. Most hummingbirds
    are 2 to 3 grams in weight. One species, the ruby-throated
    hummingbird, spends the winter near the equator, but flies
    all the way to Canada for the summer months. This is truly
    an amazing thing. How does such a small bird do that?
    Well, it flies at speeds of about 50 km an hour. It eats
    every ten minutes, consuming two times its own body
    weight each day to maintain its energy.
    The bee hummingbird lives in Cuba. It weighs only 1.5
    grams. Its eggs are smaller than a pea. Another
    interesting fact about hummingbirds is that they are the
    only birds that can fly backwards.
    When you dig deep, you can find a lot of amazing things
    about birds. For example, a bird’s heart beats 400 times a
    minute while resting and 1,000 beats per minute while
    flying. Compare that with a human’s heart, which beats
    about 75 times a minute.
    Take a minute and watch a bird soar in the sky. How do
    they fly? Well, that’s another story for another time.

    The Cat and the Christmas Tree
    In my culture, around mid-December, we go out and buy a
    Christmas tree and put it in the house. We decorate it with
    lights and other things. These trees can be quite beautiful,
    and they always give the air a special pine smell. It smells
    like Christmas to me.
    My mother doesn’t like our cat, especially at Christmas
    because the cat can’t resist trying to play with the shiny
    decorations on the tree. This Christmas was no different.
    Every time the cat got close to the tree, my mother yelled
    at it. The cat soon decided that this was a fun game. I
    actually think he enjoyed getting my mother mad.
    Mom worked very hard this Christmas. It seemed that she
    tried harder than anyone in the family to make Christmas
    special for us. She made special Christmas meals and
    wrapped all the presents. Needless to say, Mom was very
    tired. I think she was even stressed about the coming
    Christmas Day.
    It was finally the night before Christmas, and not a
    creature was moving except our cat. He had been chased
    from the Christmas tree three times that evening. We
    didn’t see him the rest of the night.
    At about midnight, my mother got up from bed to get a
    glass of water. Suddenly, we heard her screaming that
    there was someone in the house. We cautiously followed
    Dad out to the living room.
    There was someone hiding in the Christmas tree! We
    could see the branches moving slightly. My father moved
    towards the tree with a baseball bat in his hand.
    Suddenly, the tree moved again. I saw two small eyes
    looking out at us from the tree, and I shone the flashlight
    at the eyes. It was not a burglar. It was our cat! He was
    inside the tree, stuck between two small branches.
    Before I freed him, I took a picture. Everyone, including
    my mother, laughed at what had happened.
    The next day, we exchanged gifts. The biggest laugh
    came when Mom opened a special present from all of us--
    a picture of the cat in the Christmas tree.

    Better to Give
    There was a preacher who was so poor that he didn’t
    even have a church to preach in. But this didn’t stop him
    from working tirelessly. He had a young assistant, and
    together they would go from house to house, bringing food
    and clothes to those in need. When people asked where
    these came from, he answered, “From people in other
    towns. Remember, it is better to give than to receive.”
    One day, as the two men were travelling, the young
    preacher looked back and saw that the old man had fallen
    to the ground. Just before he died, the old preacher said,
    “My young friend, I have come to the end of my journey. It
    is up to you to carry on our work.”
    A few days later, there was a funeral for the old man, and
    hundreds of people came from many miles away.
    A man from one village said, “We’d like to thank you
    people in the other towns for helping us when we needed
    it.” But then, a man from another town said, “We never
    helped anyone. We always got help from you!” They were
    very confused and did not know who had helped them.
    Then a very rich man said, “Let me explain. I knew the
    preacher when I was a poor child on the street. When I
    became rich, I gave him enough money to build a church.
    But instead, he used that money to help you over the
    years. He was trying to get you all to understand charity,
    but it seems that you have never learned.” The people felt
    ashamed as the rich man drove away.
    The next day, the town was awakened by the sound of
    hammering and sawing. People had come from all over
    and brought wood and tools.
    “What are you doing?” asked the young preacher. One
    man answered, “For forty years, the old preacher tried to
    teach us. We finally learned!”
    Within a few weeks, there was a small church. On the
    front of it, there was a sign that said, “It is better to give
    than to receive.” The young preacher knew that the old
    preacher would be very happy.

    An Accident at Home
    After a day of hard work as a construction worker, Kevin’s
    father was happy to return home. His plan was to take a
    shower, and then to relax and enjoy the rest of the day.
    Just as he was finishing his shower, the phone rang. “Dad,
    it’s for you. Hurry up!” Kevin shouted. His father rushed to
    finish up his shower. As he was getting out of the bath, he
    slipped and fell on the floor.
    “Owww!” Kevin’s dad cried loudly. He had fallen with the
    whole weight of his body on his left foot! Hearing the
    shout, Kevin ran to check and found his dad lying on the
    floor with his left foot twisted nearly 180 degrees. It looked
    like it was broken. His father’s face turned pale, and he
    said calmly to his son, “Kevin, call your mom and tell her
    to come home.”
    Kevin punched the numbers nervously, and repeated to
    his mom what his Dad had just said. His mother worked at
    a nearby grocery store and was home in less than ten
    minutes.
    Together, they helped Kevin’s father hop on one leg to the
    car in the garage.
    Mom drove the car directly to the emergency room at the
    hospital. The doctor checked the foot carefully, and then
    asked Kevin’s dad to hold his breath. All of a sudden, the
    doctor twisted Kevin’s father’s foot to set it back to the
    correct place.
    “Ahhh!” The sound his dad made was horrible. But his left
    foot was back in its normal position. The doctor explained
    to Kevin’s father that he would need to use crutches to
    walk for at least three weeks.
    “Slipping on a wet floor or in the bathtub is one of the most
    common accidents around the home,” the doctor said.
    “It can be very dangerous. Some people fall and bump
    their heads on the edge of a piece of furniture, causing
    serious concussions.”
    Kevin’s mom comforted Dad, “It could be worse,” she said.
    “Next time, don’t rush to get out of the bathtub.”

    A Bowl of Stew for a Birthright
    (adapted from a Bible story)
    Isaac, one of the great leaders of the Hebrews, was
    blessed with twin boys. The first son, Esau, was born only
    a few seconds before his twin brother, Jacob. But in the
    law and custom of the land, the oldest male child was
    given a “birthright”. This meant that when his father died,
    he would receive more than all the other sons from his
    father’s worldly goods.
    The two boys were as different as night and day. Esau
    was gruff and unhappy. He made his living as a hunter.
    Jacob, on the other hand, was happy and wise. He was a
    farmer, and his land was prosperous.
    One day, Esau grew hungry. He had no food, so he went
    hunting for something to eat. He worked and worked,
    walking many hours over rough land, only to return that
    evening empty-handed. He caught no animals to eat that
    day. His stomach growled with hunger.
    He noticed his brother Jacob in front of his house cooking
    a wonderful meat stew. The good smells were unbearable
    for Esau, as his hunger was great. He stopped and asked
    his brother for a bowl of this good stew.
    Jacob said that he had already promised to give the
    leftovers from his pot to a good neighbour who was also
    suffering from hunger. “But, you may have it, my brother,
    only if you will give away your birthright,” said Jacob. “If
    you give me your birthright, I shall give you a big bowl of
    this stew.”
    Esau could not resist, and he quickly agreed. “You may
    have my birthright,” he said. “I don’t care about it. A full
    belly of that good stew is what I crave.”
    Jacob dished out the bowl of stew and his brother Esau
    ate it ravenously.
    And so, for a bowl of food, Esau traded away his most
    valuable possession in the world -- his birthright.

    School for Africa
    This year, we were learning about Africa in our social
    studies class. Our teacher told us that nearly half the
    children in Africa live in poverty. They don’t have enough
    to eat. Some days, they have nothing to eat at all. They
    live in mud houses and sleep on the floor. But the worst
    thing of all is that most villages don’t have a school.
    As our teacher spoke, I thought about all the things I took
    for granted in my own life -- my MP3 player, a refrigerator
    filled to the brim with good food, spending money
    whenever I want to. There is no way to compare my life to
    that of a poor African child. My biggest worry is what I will
    do on the weekend. Her biggest worry is whether she will
    have anything to eat today.
    Our teacher told us that our class could “adopt” a village in
    Africa. All we needed to do was raise some money. With
    only $250, we could help build a school.
    Our teacher asked for a volunteer to lead a fundraising
    drive. I raised my hand right away. I don’t know why, but
    the picture of the African boys and girls that the teacher
    showed us had something to do with it.
    For the next two months, my friends and I worked really
    hard. We each went through our rooms and chose
    something that we could sell at a school sale. We held car
    washes on Saturdays. Some of us even donated our
    weekly allowance to the fund.
    Soon enough, we raised $250. Our teacher helped us
    send it to the African School Program.
    One day, a letter arrived. Our teacher read it aloud to us. A
    young boy from the village wrote, “Yesterday, we had no
    hope. Today, we can go to school just like kids all over the
    world. We will think of you often as we take our lessons in
    this wonderful new school. Thank you, from your friends in
    Africa!”

    The Box
    There was a great teacher at a local university. He was
    known throughout his country as a brilliant man. Although
    he was old, he never stopped learning, thinking, and
    wondering about the way the world worked.
    He knew that the end of his life was approaching, so he
    called his favourite students to his home.
    “I have some money and possessions that I will give to the
    poor, but to you my great friends, I will give the greatest
    gift of all. It is far more important than money, a large
    house, or a fancy car. It is the key to science. It is the key
    to all the wisdom that I have learned in my 80 years.”
    He smiled at them and said, “No, it is not magic. But it is
    magical.” He smiled again and continued, “It is under this.”
    He lifted the tablecloth on his dining room table.
    Underneath were five plain little wooden boxes.
    “There is one for each of you. Take one. But do not open
    it!” They each took a box. “Inside is the key to all the
    knowledge in the universe. Inside is the key to everything
    you ever wish to know.”
    They all looked at each other in confusion. What did he
    mean?
    “This box will give you great powers, but if you ever open
    it, all the power will be gone.”
    You are probably wondering if the old man had gone
    crazy. But remember, he was a great teacher and a
    brilliant scholar. Perhaps, there was something in each
    box. Perhaps there was nothing. But if they were to open
    their boxes, they would know for certain. And of course,
    they would stop wondering.
    “If there is one thing that a child, a scientist or an old
    person must never stop doing, it is to never stop
    wondering,” the old teacher said.
    They all took their boxes home, knowing that they would
    never open them and never stop wondering. In this simple
    way, they had just been given a final lesson from the great
    teacher.

    Not Too Much
    A girl and her grandfather were standing at the train
    station. It was time for the old man to go. He was very old
    and they both knew that this was likely the last time they
    would see each other.
    From the window by his seat, the grandfather looked down
    at the girl on the platform and said, “I wish you not too
    much.”
    “What do you mean, Grandpa?” she asked.
    “Read the letter I put on your bed. You will understand,” he
    called as the train slowly began to pull away. They waved
    goodbye. The girl cried and so did her grandfather. She
    couldn’t wait to get home and read the letter. When she
    arrived, she sat on her bed and began to read.
    Dear Granddaughter,
    In this world, people feel that more is always better. A
    faster car, more money, a bigger house... but this is not
    true. Instead of a bigger house and bigger car, I wish you
    the knowledge to know when enough is enough. For if you
    are always looking for more, you will never find it.
    I ask you to remember this old family saying that I learned
    as a child. Use it when you’re saying goodbye to someone
    who you won’t be seeing for a long time.
    I wish you success, but not too much.
    For success can spoil you.
    I wish you many years of life, but not too much.
    For life should always be worth living.
    I wish you friendship, but not too much.
    For you need but a few great friends.
    I wish you pleasure, but not too much.
    For life requires hard work too.
    I wish you food, but not too much.
    For food can kill just like hunger.
    I wish you all good things in life, but just enough.
    For enough is better than too much.
    The granddaughter smiled and put the letter in a special
    box to save for the day when she might give it to her own
    granddaughter
