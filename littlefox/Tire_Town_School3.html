    Tire Town School 29: The Plan<br />
    Roar!<br />
    Eddy’s engine started.<br />
    His tires spun.<br />
    And he took off!<br />
    Vroom!<br />
    Eddy zoomed across the parking lot.<br />
    “Go, Eddy!” Poppy cheered.<br />
    “Woo-hoo!”<br />
    “Eddy looks fast today!” said Jeb.<br />
    “Yes!” said Dipper.<br />
    Mr. Grill came outside.<br />
    “Time for class!” he said.<br />
    Eddy drove over.<br />
    Everyone parked near the teacher.<br />
    “Good morning, Mr. Grill,” they said.<br />
    “What’s the plan today?” asked Dipper.<br />
    “Is there a field trip?”<br />
    “No,” said Mr. Grill.<br />
    “Will we go fast?” asked Zippy.<br />
    “No,” said Mr. Grill.<br />
    “What will we do?” asked Poppy.<br />
    Mr. Grill smiled.<br />
    “We will stop,” he said.<br />
    “Stop?” cried Zippy.<br />
    “That’s right,” said Mr. Grill.<br />
    “Today we’ll use our brakes!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 30: Brakes Are Boring<br />
    “Brakes?” cried Zippy.<br />
    “Brakes are boring!”<br />
    Eddy didn’t like Zippy.<br />
    But Zippy was right.<br />
    Brakes were boring.<br />
    “Brakes are very important,” said Mr. Grill.<br />
    “First we must check them.”<br />
    The teacher drove slowly.<br />
    Then he stopped.<br />
    “See?” he said.<br />
    “My brakes work.<br />
    Now you all try.”<br />
    Most students checked their brakes.<br />
    But Zippy didn’t.<br />
    “My brakes are fine,” said Zippy.<br />
    “I don’t need to check them.”<br />
    Mr. Grill drove around the parking lot.<br />
    “Use brakes when you turn,” he said.<br />
    Mr. Grill slowed down.<br />
    He made a turn.<br />
    Then he went faster.<br />
    “Ugh,” said Zippy.<br />
    “Race cars never slow down.”<br />
    “Yeah!” said Eddy.<br />
    “I won’t check my brakes either.”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 31: No Brakes!<br />
    Eddy was at the racetrack.<br />
    Roar!<br />
    Eddy took off!<br />
    There was a bend in the track.<br />
    Eddy didn’t slow down.<br />
    He shot around the bend.<br />
    But then he slid.<br />
    “Whoa!” cried Eddy.<br />
    “I almost crashed!”<br />
    There was another bend.<br />
    “I’ll slow down this time,” he thought.<br />
    Eddy hit his brakes.<br />
    But they didn’t work.<br />
    Crash!<br />
    “Ouch!” cried Eddy.<br />
    Eddy rolled slowly to the garage.<br />
    Mr. Grill fixed his brakes.<br />
    Later Eddy was in the parking lot.<br />
    “Let’s play tag!” said Poppy.<br />
    Eddy roared his engine .<br />
    He started to drive.<br />
    But then he remembered the crash.<br />
    Eddy stopped.<br />
    “I’m scared to go fast!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 32: Playing in the Dirt<br />
    Eddy drove to the construction site.<br />
    He went slowly.<br />
    He didn’t want to crash again.<br />
    “Hey, Jeb,” said Eddy.<br />
    “Let’s play in the dirt!”<br />
    Poppy and Dipper drove over.<br />
    “Eddy!” said Poppy.<br />
    “Don’t you want to play tag?”<br />
    “No,” said Eddy.<br />
    “I don’t want to crash again.”<br />
    Jeb loaded dirt into Eddy’s dumper.<br />
    Eddy dumped the dirt.<br />
    “You won’t crash,” said Dipper.<br />
    “Don’t you want to go fast?”<br />
    “No,” said Eddy.<br />
    Zippy drove over.<br />
    “Hey, slowpoke!” he said.<br />
    “Want to race?”<br />
    “Grr!” said Eddy.<br />
    “Leave Eddy alone,” said Dipper.<br />
    “He doesn’t want to—”<br />
    Roar!<br />
    Eddy roared his engine.<br />
    He quickly checked his brakes.<br />
    Then he took off!<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 33: Up, Up, Up!<br />
    “I love field trips,” said Eddy.<br />
    “The new bridge will be cool.<br />
    I can’t wait to see it!”<br />
    Everyone drove up a hill.<br />
    “This hill is steep!” said Poppy.<br />
    “I’m tired,” said Jeb.<br />
    “Me too,” said Dipper.<br />
    “I’m too tired to play music.”<br />
    “Up, up, up!” said Ms. Fender.<br />
    “We’re almost there!”<br />
    “Ugh!” said Zippy.<br />
    Eddy saw mountains .<br />
    He felt the wind.<br />
    “Wow!” he said.<br />
    “Keep going, everyone!” said Ms. Fender.<br />
    “The new bridge is close!”<br />
    The road made a sharp turn.<br />
    Then Eddy saw something red.<br />
    “Whoa!” said Eddy.<br />
    “The new bridge!”<br />
    Ms. Fender smiled.<br />
    “Here we are!” she said.<br />
    “Who will go across first?”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 34: The New Bridge<br />
    Eddy looked at the new bridge.<br />
    “Oh boy!” he said.<br />
    He drove closer.<br />
    Eddy looked up.<br />
    He saw clouds.<br />
    Then Eddy looked down.<br />
    The ground was far below.<br />
    There was a river.<br />
    It looked tiny.<br />
    Eddy gulped.<br />
    “We’re up very high!” he thought.<br />
    “Who’s going first?” Ms. Fender asked.<br />
    “Not me!” said Dipper.<br />
    “Not me!” said Jeb.<br />
    “Not me!” said Poppy.<br />
    “The bridge is too high!”<br />
    “Don’t be scared,” said Ms. Fender.<br />
    “The bridge is very safe.”<br />
    Then Ms. Fender saw Eddy.<br />
    “Oh, Eddy!” said Ms. Fender.<br />
    “You don’t seem scared.<br />
    Do you want to go first?”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 35: Eddy Is Brave<br />
    Eddy was scared.<br />
    The bridge was too high!<br />
    “Go ahead, Eddy!” said Ms. Fender.<br />
    “Drive across the bridge.”<br />
    Eddy backed up a little.<br />
    “Go, Eddy!” Poppy cheered.<br />
    “You can do it!”<br />
    “Eddy is brave!” said Dipper.<br />
    “He’s braver than we are!” said Jeb.<br />
    Zippy laughed.<br />
    “Eddy is not brave.<br />
    He’s scared!”<br />
    Eddy felt hot all over.<br />
    “I’m not scared!” he yelled.<br />
    “Oh yeah?” said Zippy.<br />
    “Then cross the bridge.”<br />
    “Fine,” said Eddy.<br />
    “I will!”<br />
    Eddy took a deep breath.<br />
    He rolled onto the bridge.<br />
    Eddy drove very slowly.<br />
    “I can be brave,” he thought.<br />
    “I just won’t look down.”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 36: Across the Bridge<br />
    Eddy was on the bridge.<br />
    “This bridge isn’t scary,” he thought.<br />
    Some birds flew by.<br />
    “Birds aren’t scary,” Eddy thought.<br />
    A wind blew.<br />
    “Wind isn’t scary,” Eddy thought.<br />
    Then a stronger wind blew.<br />
    The bridge shook!<br />
    “Ahh!” Eddy screamed.<br />
    He spun his tires.<br />
    And he shot across the bridge!<br />
    Eddy stopped on the other side.<br />
    “Whew!” said Eddy.<br />
    “I’m safe!”<br />
    Eddy looked back.<br />
    Poppy drove onto the bridge.<br />
    Everyone else followed Poppy.<br />
    Soon everyone was on Eddy’s side.<br />
    “Thanks, Eddy,” said Poppy.<br />
    “You were very brave.<br />
    You made us brave!”<br />
    “Well done, Eddy,” said Ms. Fender.<br />
    Eddy grinned.<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 37: The Racing Team<br />
    “I have some news,” said Mr. Grill.<br />
    “I’m forming a racing team.”<br />
    “What?” cried Eddy.<br />
    “Really?” said Zippy.<br />
    “Tryouts are next week,” said Mr. Grill.<br />
    “I’ll pick the fastest cars.<br />
    They’ll get team stickers.”<br />
    “Oh boy!” said Eddy.<br />
    “I hope I make the team.”<br />
    “You will,” said Poppy.<br />
    “You’re fast,” said Jeb.<br />
    “We’ll help you train,” said Dipper.<br />
    Eddy trained all week.<br />
    He drove faster each day.<br />
    His friends cheered him on.<br />
    “Go, Eddy!” said Jeb.<br />
    Zippy flew by Eddy.<br />
    “Ha-ha!” said Zippy.<br />
    “Eddy won’t make the team!”<br />
    Eddy stopped.<br />
    “Don’t listen to Zippy,” said Poppy.<br />
    “You’ll make the team.”<br />
    Eddy sighed.<br />
    “I hope you’re right.”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 38: Tryouts<br />
    It was the day of tryouts.<br />
    Eddy saw Zippy.<br />
    He saw other cars too.<br />
    They all looked pretty fast.<br />
    “Welcome to tryouts,” said Mr. Grill.<br />
    “I need four fast racers.”<br />
    “How will you pick them?” Zippy asked.<br />
    “We’ll have a race,” said Mr. Grill.<br />
    “I’ll pick the four winners.”<br />
    “Me!” said Zippy.<br />
    “Maybe,” said Mr. Grill.<br />
    “Everyone, line up.”<br />
    Eddy went to the starting line.<br />
    He was between two big cars.<br />
    Their engines rumbled.<br />
    Eddy gulped.<br />
    But then he heard his friends.<br />
    “You can do it, Eddy!” Poppy shouted.<br />
    “Good luck, everyone,” said Mr. Grill.<br />
    “Ready, set . . . go!”<br />
    Eddy took off.<br />
    “I can do this,” he thought.<br />
    “I can make the team!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 39: Stickers<br />
    Eddy raced.<br />
    Most cars flew ahead of Eddy.<br />
    But some cars were behind him.<br />
    “At least I’m not last,” Eddy thought.<br />
    Then Eddy passed a car.<br />
    “Cool!” said Eddy.<br />
    Vroom!<br />
    Eddy picked up speed.<br />
    He went around the bend.<br />
    Eddy passed another car.<br />
    Then he passed another.<br />
    “Wow!” said Eddy.<br />
    “I really am fast!<br />
    I’m going to make the team!”<br />
    Eddy saw the finish line.<br />
    He raced across it.<br />
    “I won!” Zippy was shouting.<br />
    Eddy looked over.<br />
    Three other cars were with Zippy.<br />
    They all had team stickers.<br />
    “The four winners,” thought Eddy.<br />
    “Sorry, Eddy,” said Mr. Grill.<br />
    “You were pretty fast.<br />
    But you didn’t make the team.”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 40: The Best Team Ever<br />
    Eddy drove toward his friends.<br />
    He felt awful.<br />
    Zippy flew past Eddy.<br />
    “I made the team!” Zippy shouted.<br />
    “And Eddy didn’t!”<br />
    Poppy looked at Eddy.<br />
    She whispered to Dipper and Jeb.<br />
    The three of them raced away.<br />
    They drove behind the garage.<br />
    Eddy gasped.<br />
    “My friends don’t like me anymore!” he thought.<br />
    Eddy grew angry.<br />
    “They’re mean!” he thought.<br />
    “I’ll tell them that!”<br />
    Eddy drove behind the garage.<br />
    “Surprise!” shouted Poppy.<br />
    “Huh?” said Eddy.<br />
    Poppy stuck a sticker on Eddy.<br />
    “There!” she said.<br />
    “Now you’re on a team!”<br />
    “What team?” asked Eddy.<br />
    “Our team!” said Dipper.<br />
    “It’s a friends’ team!” said Jeb.<br />
    Eddy grinned.<br />
    It was the best team ever.<br />
