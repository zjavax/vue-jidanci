Don’t Fix It
Luke had a new alarm clock. It was big and round with two
bells on top.
It ticked and tocked all night long. In the morning, it
jangled and rang loud enough to wake the whole
neighbourhood!
Luke wondered how it worked. So, he used his father’s
tools to open the clock.
Springs and bits exploded everywhere! Luke tried to put
them all back in the clock, but they wouldn’t fit. So, he sat
on the clock until it closed.
He turned the key and shook the clock. It made funny
rattling noises, but it wouldn’t tick or tock!
Luke put the springs and bits in a box. He decided to take
the box to his Uncle Tony.
Uncle Tony looked at the bits. He looked at Luke. Then,
he got his car and took Luke to the store to buy a new
clock.
“Remember, Luke!” Uncle Tony said, “If something works,
DON’T FIX IT!”

That’s a BIG Pumpkin
Harry Redin has a strange hobby. When he first started
his hobby, all his friends laughed at him.
What is Harry’s hobby? Harry grows pumpkins -- GIANT
pumpkins.
Last year, Harry set the world record for growing the
biggest pumpkin.
How big was it? It was 91 4 pounds! Measured with a tape,
it was 1 4 feet around its middle. It took nearly fifteen
people to move it. And, if you carved it out, it was big
enough for three people to get inside.
Harry laughed and said, “You could make nearly 1,000
pumpkin pies with this pumpkin.”
It takes a lot of work to grow a pumpkin like this one. But
it’s Harry’s hobby and he loves it.
How much did Harry win at the competition? He took
home a cheque for $1 5,000. His friends aren’t laughing at
his hobby now.

Apple Time
Last Saturday, Janet and her friends went to an apple
orchard. They had been waiting for this day for months.
Back in early September, their teacher told them, “One
day this fall, we are all going to pick apples.” Finally, the
day came.
When the school bus pulled up to the orchard, the children
couldn’t wait to get off.
There were apples everywhere!
Some were on high branches. Some apples were right in
front of them. Others had fallen to the ground. All the kids
had to do was pick them up and put them in their baskets!
After just half an hour, all the baskets were full of apples.
The farmer carried the baskets to the wagon.
Soon, everyone was eating a freshly picked apple. They
were so sweet and crisp!
Janet decided to bring home a basket of apples for her
mother. This way, she could enjoy the fruits of her labour
at home too!

Mr. Squirrel
In our backyard, there lives an old squirrel. He has been
there for as long as I can remember. I named him Mr.
Squirrel.
One day, the old squirrel was being chased by our
neighbour’s young cat. Just as the cat was about to catch
him, Mr. Squirrel ran onto the middle of the road.
I knew from years of watching this squirrel that he knew
how to cross the road. I had seen him run across many
times. But the young cat had never crossed the road. He
didn’t know how dangerous it was to run across the busy
road.
“SCREEEEECCHH!”
A car had just missed the young cat. The car stopped in
the middle of the road as the old squirrel escaped up a
tree.
Maybe Mr. Squirrel did it on purpose, maybe he didn’t.
Regardless, he was smart to run away from that cat!
I was amazed.

Just One More House
The cold wind blew through the trees. But Eddy was warm
in his cowboy costume. “Let’s go!” he said.
His mom walked with him to the first house. He rang the
doorbell and said, “Trick or treat!” The woman at the door
gave Eddy a piece of candy. He put it in his bag.
He walked from house to house for hours, collecting lots
of candy.
“Let’s go home now,” said Mom. “Your brother was sad
that he couldn’t come.”
“Just one more house,” Eddy said. He walked to the next
house and got another piece of candy.
“Let’s go home now,” said Mom. “Your brother is home
sick.”
“Just one more house,” Eddy said as he walked to the
next house. He got another piece of candy.
“Let’s go home now,” said Mom again. “We’ve been gone
too long.”
Eddy ran all the way home. He kicked off his cowboy
boots and ran to his brother’s room. Then he dumped his
bag of candy on his brother’s bed. “I got these for you,” he
said. “Happy Halloween!”

Cars (I)
It was about 1 672. A European man from Belgium was
visiting a Chinese emperor. As a gift to the Emperor, the
man made a toy.
The toy was powered by steam. It had wheels. It was
about 65 centimetres long. This toy might have been the
very first model car.
Of course, the car was too small for a person. But, many
people think that this was the beginning of trains, cars and
even steam-powered boats.
Today, cars are everywhere. We all know that they pollute
a lot. They also crowd our roads. And they can be very
unsafe if people aren’t careful when they drive them.
But why do people still like cars? Because cars are good
in a lot of ways too.
1 0-7
Cars (II)
Cars help people get to places that are far away. They
travel long distances quickly. And, they bring families
together.
Of course, most people in the world don’t have a car.
Some people have never even seen a car. Maybe this
isn’t such a bad thing.
Can you imagine how much fun people would have if they
drove horse carriages, or if the streets were full of people
riding bikes? You could chat with the person next to you
while riding your bike.
One hundred years ago, there were only a few cars in the
whole world. Today, there is one car for every eleven
people on earth. How many cars is that?
Well, that’s about 600 million cars on our little planet.
Think about how much gas these cars can burn!
I think I’ll stick with my bicycle for now. It never needs gas!

Fall
Fall comes in slowly. Leaves start changing the colour and
soon after, they fall down.
“Can we rake the leaves yet, Dad?” asked Sarah.
“Not until they are all down,” said Dad.
Sarah looked up at the branches of the tree. There were a
bunch of leaves left. Sarah grabbed the trunk of the tree.
She tried to shake it. But that didn’t make any leaves fall.
Sarah waited in her tree fort. She peaked out the window
to see if the leaves had fallen yet. They hadn’t.
Sarah jumped up and down in her tree fort. The tree
shook. A few leaves fell, but most of them were still on the
tree.
Sarah was cold. The wind was getting stronger. She gave
up waiting for the leaves to fall. She climbed down from
her tree fort. A great gust of wind blew. Just then, the
leaves on the tree swirled to the ground.
“Yay!” yelled Sarah. She started raking the leaves into a
pile. Dad helped her make the pile huge.
“One, two, three!” yelled Sarah. Sarah and Dad jumped
into the pile of leaves together.

A Nature Artist
Michael is Dan’s best friend. One day, he received a
special gift from Dan’s father. It was a gourd with a little
animal carved on it. Why was it special?
Well, Dan’s father grew the gourd himself.
Every spring, Dan’s dad plants little seeds, planning to
create some special gifts. Every day, he nurtures the soil
and watches his plants carefully.
The plants grow bigger and bigger. Then, little flowers
appear. Gradually, the flowers change into little fruits,
which grow bigger with each day.
Dan’s dad then turns the fruits to expose them evenly to
the sun. This ensures that the colour of the fruits is
uniform.
By fall, the fruits are ready to be cut from the plants. That’s
when Dan’s dad harvests them.
Using a special tool, he carves little animals on the
grounds. Then, he gives these special gifts to his son and
his son’s best friend.
Dan’s father is an amazing artist -- a nature artist.

Perfect
Ryan got a toy sailboat and a kite for his birthday. The
sailboat was his favourite gift.
Following the instructions, he took the pieces of the
sailboat out of the box and put them together. Ryan
looked at his finished sailboat. “Perfect!” he said.
Ryan took the sailboat to the pond to test it out. He felt the
wind. It blew hard against his face. “Perfect!” he said.
Ryan put the sailboat in the water. It sailed fast, but the
strong wind blew it over. “That’s not perfect,” he said.
Ryan pulled the sailboat to shore. He set it up again. It
sailed fast, but the strong wind blew it over again. “That’s
not perfect!” said Ryan.
Just then, Ryan’s dad walked to the pond and handed
Ryan his new kite. Ryan smiled as the wind rustled
through his hair. “Now that’s perfect!” he said.

Lost at the Beach
Yesterday at the beach, I saw a man walking slowly. He
was holding a strange machine in his hand.
Every now and then, he stopped to dig in the sand. I was
curious. What was the man doing?
“I am searching for treasure,” he said.
“A treasure?” I asked.
“Yes,” the man told me. “This machine is a metal detector.
It’s a special machine that can find valuable things under
the sand.”
Many people lose things in the sand. A metal detector can
find things like coins, rings, and keys. In fact, it can find
anything made of metal, even when it is buried in the
sand.
When the machine passes over metal, it beeps loudly. It
tells the man there is something under the sand. So, he
digs and usually finds something valuable.
Then, he takes the treasures to the Lost and Found,
where people come to look for things they have lost on the
beach.

Before Computers
Have you ever wondered how people typed before
computers?
More than one hundred years ago, people started using
machines that sat on their desks. They were called
typewriters. They had keyboards just like computers. But
they were very different.
There was no screen to look at. You would put a piece of
paper in the typewriter. Each letter on the keyboard was
connected to a metal arm that reached up and stamped
the paper with ink as you typed!
If you made a mistake, you had to start over with a new
piece of paper or use a special drop of white paint to cover
your mistake.
These typewriters had hundreds of moving parts and were
very hard to fix.
It took people a long time to type anything with a
typewriter. But, some people could type more than 1 20
words per minute on these old machines -- with no
mistakes!
Today, most people can type about 60 words per minute
on a computer. How fast can you type?

Touching the Tiger (I)
One day, a zookeeper discovered that the tiger in the zoo
wasn’t eating his food. What could be wrong? Just a day
ago, the tiger was eating chickens happily. Now, the tiger
was having difficulty eating anything at all.
The zookeeper decided to see Doctor Wong. He wanted
the doctor to find out why the tiger had stopped eating.
After watching the animal for a while, Doctor Wong told
the zookeeper that the tiger had something stuck in his
throat.
“What should we do?” asked the zookeeper.
“We have to do a surgery on the tiger,” the doctor
answered.
“You mean that we have to open the tiger’s mouth to get
the thing out?” asked the zookeeper, his eyes wide with
fear.
“Yes.”
“But how?” the zookeeper wondered.
1 0-1 4
Touching the Tiger (II)
The doctor said that he had to give the tiger a special
needle to put him to sleep. Then, he could use tools to
take the thing out of the tiger’s throat.
It was scary. The zookeeper had never even touched the
tiger before. Now the doctor wanted to put his hand into
the mouth of the beast!
There was another problem. The doctor didn’t know how
much medicine to use for a tiger. If he didn’t use enough
medicine, the tiger might wake up before they finished the
job. If he used too much, the tiger might never wake up.
Doctor Wong carefully calculated the amount of medicine
needed for the weight of the tiger. Then he gave the tiger
the needle.
When the tiger went to sleep, the doctor and his assistants
worked quickly. They opened its mouth and used some
tools to get down deep into the tiger’s throat.
Fifteen minutes later, they found a chicken bone and
removed it. A little while after the surgery, the tiger woke
up and started eating again.

Under the Table
Sam liked to play under the table. Mom and Dad sat
beside the table. The dog slept on the rug. Under the table
was a secret place — it was Sam’s magic den.
In the magic den, under the table, Sam could see his mom
and dad’s shoes.
He could see the dog’s paws. Sometimes, in the evening,
when the sky got dark, Sam could see big, shiny green
eyes.
He pretended the big green eyes belonged to a monster
waiting to gobble him up.
That’s when the magic den under the table turned into a
scary place.
Sam moved closer to Mom.
“Meowwwwww!” said the scary monster as it purred and
rubbed against Sam’s foot. Sam laughed. The cat was not
as scary in the light. It was the same cat in the dark.
Sometimes things look scary in the dark. But when the
lights come on, they aren’t that bad at all!

The Greedy Dog
(based on a European fable)
There once was a greedy dog that was very big. All the
other dogs were afraid of him.
One day, the greedy dog was sitting beside a pond. He
saw a little old dog with a bone. The greedy dog ran over
and took the bone from the little dog.
But, the little old dog was very wise. He had a plan.
He stood on a large rock in the water. He looked down
into the water and started to bark.
“What are you barking at?” the greedy dog asked.
“Come and see,” replied the little dog.
The greedy dog walked closer to the pond and looked into
the water. He saw a big dog with a bone staring back at
him. He didn’t know that he was looking at his own
reflection.
So, the greedy dog dropped his bone and tried to steal the
one from the dog in the water.
The little dog, who had been watching the whole time,
picked up his bone and ran away.

Walking Sweater
Jill has a new sweater. Her grandmother made it for her.
That makes it really special. Even more special is that her
sweater used to walk around on four legs on her
grandparents’ farm.
How can a sweater walk? Well, Jill’s new sweater is made
of wool.
Do you know where wool comes from? It comes from
sheep. And of course, sheep walk on four legs. Jill’s
grandparents raise sheep.
Once a year, they cut the sheep’s fur. This is called wool.
Jill’s grandma washes the wool. Then she spins it on a
machine.
When she is finished, she has wonderful strings of pure
wool. This is called yarn. She uses special needles to turn
the yarn into a sweater.
Jill wore her new sweater to school. The kids were
amazed when she explained how her sweater once
walked around on four legs.

Falling Leaves, Rising Trees
When I was young, I thought falling leaves were sad. They
fall at the end of summer and are a sign that winter is
coming.
The leaves on the ground were alive in summer. But a dry
leaf on the ground is dead, right?
Well, this is just one step in the life of a tree.
The leaves that fall on the ground are food for the soil.
The soil is food for the tree. The tree takes the food from
the soil and grows bigger.
It’s a never-ending circle of life.
You know what else is great? The leaves make the fall
season beautiful too!
Now, I am no longer sad when fall comes.

A Worrying Guy
John is a typical teenager. But one morning while he was
in the shower, he noticed that he was losing a lot of hair.
This made John worry.
As time went by, more and more hair seemed to fall off his
head.
“What’s happening to me?” John wondered. “Why am I
slowly going bald?” John thought that without hair he
would look old and unattractive.
He couldn’t sleep at night. He didn’t let anyone touch his
hair, not even himself. He was afraid to get a haircut.
Eventually, he was even afraid to wash his hair in the
shower. Still, his hair kept falling out.
John decided to see a doctor. After looking at John’s head
and asking a few questions, the doctor said, “You worry
too much. It’s normal for hair to fall out. But, if you worry
too much, your hair will fall out even faster.”
John took this advice and two months later, his hair was
back to normal.

Freddy the Frog
Steve had a pet frog. He called it Freddy. One day, Steve
decided to teach Freddy some tricks.
Steve built a hurdle. He sat the frog in front of it and said,
“Jump!” Freddy jumped, but in another direction.
“No, Freddy,” said Steve. “Jump over the hurdle.” Steve
lifted Freddy over the hurdle so he would understand.
But, it didn’t work.
Every time Steve told Freddy to jump, the frog would just
stare at the hurdle or jump in another direction.
All of a sudden, Steve had an idea. He knew that flies
were Freddy’s favourite food. So, he caught one and held
it up by the hurdle.
	
	“Jump!” At last, Freddy jumped over the hurdle. He really
wanted to eat that fly.
“I bet you’re the only frog in the world that can do tricks!”
Steve said proudly.

Sun, Moon and Water (I)
(based on a traditional African story)
Why do the sun and moon live in the sky? That’s an
interesting question. And here’s an interesting answer.
Long ago, the sun and moon lived on earth like everyone
else. During this time, the sun and the water were very
good friends. Every day, Sun visited his friend Water.
They had many good and interesting conversations.
However, there was a problem. Water never returned the
honour of visiting Sun in his home.
One day, Sun asked Water why he did not visit. “Your
house is too small,” explained Water. “My family is big and
we take up a lot of room.”
“I will build a big house so you can come visit me there,”
answered Sun. “And you must bring all your family too!”
Water agreed, making his good friend Sun very happy,
indeed!

Sun, Moon and Water (II)
(based on a traditional African story)
Sun returned home and told his wife, Moon, what he was
going to do. She agreed.
And so, Sun built a very big house and invited Water for a
visit. Water knocked and asked if he could come in.
“Please, my good friend,” said the sun. “Please come in.”
Soon, the water level started rising in the house.
Water’s family was VERY large, indeed.
“Shall we stop now?” cried Water. “There are SO many of
us and already, the water is up to your knees.” But
Sun cried, “Come in, come in! Everyone is welcome in our
home!”
As more and more of the Water family entered the house,
the water soon rose to the roof. Sun and Moon became
frightened. Just as the water filled the entire house, they
escaped and floated up high into the sky.
And that is why, today, water covers the earth and the sun
and moon shine down on us from the sky.

George’s Brother
George had no brothers and no sisters. “I wish I had a
brother or a sister,” George would always say.
“Maybe someday,” replied Mom and Dad.
“I wish I had a brother or sister,” George told Grandma.
“Maybe you could sponsor a child,” suggested Grandma.
“What does that mean?” asked George.
“You could send money to help a child in a poor country.
Your money would help them buy food and clothes, and
go to school.”
Grandma continued, “You could give the money from your
allowance. And I could give the rest. That way, you would
have the brother or sister you always wanted. And I would
have another grandchild.”
George liked this idea. With Grandma, he wrote a letter to
Sponsor a Child.
One day, George got an envelope in the mail. Inside was
a picture of a boy named Niawat who lived in a country
far, far away.
“This is my brother,” said George, showing the picture to
everyone. George wrote a letter to Niawat and Niawat
wrote back. They were both happy to be brothers in a
special way.

It Tastes Like Vinegar
Have you ever tasted vinegar? It is very sour. My dad
loves vinegar. I always wondered, “How could anyone like
something that tastes like that?”
He puts vinegar on french fries. He even puts it on
noodles! I thought this was gross.
One day, we had a big family dinner. Many family
members came. I watched my dad prepare his famous
salad dressing that we all love. He mixed olive oil, garlic,
salt, honey and something from a bottle. That something
was brown.
“What is that?” I asked my dad.
“That is the special part. Brown vinegar!” he said. “Try it.” I
closed my eyes and tasted it. It was very good!
Now, I am a big fan of vinegar, I like lots of brown vinegar
on my french fries.
What about you? You’ll never knew unless you try!

Feeling Good with Music
We all have music we love to listen to. But, we don’t all
like the same music. I like quiet music, but my brother
loves rock and roll. And my dad loves bagpipe music.
One day, I was feeling sick so I turned on my favourite
music. Soon, I felt much better.
Later, when I told this to my doctor, she said, “Music is
very powerful. It actually helps people feel better.”
She added, “Even people with head injuries find that
music helps them get better, faster.”
When I got home afterwards, my brother was listening to
his music. It was very loud, so I asked him to turn it down.
He said, “I don’t feel well and it makes me feel better.”
“Oh no!” I thought. “I hope Dad doesn’t get sick too!”
My poor ears will hurt!

The High Jumper
Dina is a miracle girl at my school. She always wins many
medals at school sports meets.
This year, she won a gold medal for high jump. She
jumped over 1 .40 metres. That is nearly as tall as her!
The amazing thing is that she just survived a big
earthquake and recovered from it.
Two years ago, the earthquake hit her city while she was
sleeping. Her house collapsed and she was buried alive.
When the rescue team found her, she couldn’t move her
legs. The major joints were all broken. She was taken to a
hospital in a helicopter. Doctors immediately operated to
fix her legs and other injuries.
People thought she would be disabled forever. But, she
recovered. And now, she walks normally. On top of that,
she is the greatest athlete in the whole school!

How Do Birds Eat?
Little Ann is watching a bird eat. The bird is not chewing.
“I chew my food with my teeth,” she thinks. “Do birds have
teeth?” she wonders.
No, Ann. Birds do not have teeth.
Look at the pointed thing on a bird’s head. It’s called a
“beak”. Birds use their beaks to pick up food.
Then, they swallow it without chewing. But the food
doesn’t go directly to the stomach. Birds store food in a
special place in their necks called a “crop”. Birds are the
only animals that have crops.
After a while, the food slowly moves down to the bird’s
stomach. Inside the stomach, there is a special part called
a “gizzard”. The gizzard is filled with sand and small
stones that break down food into very small pieces.
Some birds have VERY strong gizzards that can even
break down small pieces of steel! Wow! That is really
strong.
All animals eat. But not all animals need teeth to eat well.
That’s just the way it is in nature.

Guess the Holiday!
Can you guess my favourite holiday? Here are some
hints. It happens once a year in the fall, usually only in
Canada and the United States.
We get together with family and close friends to give
thanks for everything we have.
It celebrates a good harvest, hard work, health, family and
friends.
There is always a huge dinner with lots of good food like
turkey, potatoes, gravy, and my favourite, pumpkin pie!
On this day, everyone is in a good mood!
Have you guessed it yet?
That’s right -- it’s Thanksgiving. And it’s the best holiday to
me and my family. Why? Because it makes everyone stop
to think about the important things in life.

A Sudden Danger!
My sister had a scare at dinner the other day. After eating
her meal, her tongue suddenly swelled up. Dad
immediately took her to see a doctor.
The doctor said, “You are allergic to something.”
“What?” my sister was very surprised. “I have never been
allergic to anything.”
The doctor explained. “An allergy happens when your
body overreacts to something. Allergies can be caused by
food, drinks or even air. Sometimes, even a tiny thing can
become a big problem for some people.”
The doctor continued, “Allergies can happen at any age. I
have an 88-year-old lady who came to see me because
she developed a new allergy. ”
My sister was still puzzled by her new allergy. “How do I
get rid of it?” she asked.
“Well, you need to identify the source of the allergy.
Then, like the saying goes, prevention is the best cure.”
said the doctor.

Monster Dad
October 31 st of every year is a special day. It is called
Halloween.
On this night, kids dress up as scary monsters. They
knock on doors and yell, “Trick or treat!” This is a fun way
of saying, “Give us some candy or we will play a trick on
you!”
My dad loves Halloween.
Sometimes, he dresses up as a scary monster too. When
the doorbell rings, he throws the door open and yells
“AAARRRGGHHHH!”
This Halloween, my dad got his own special surprise.
The doorbell rang. As usual, he threw the door open and
roared. But guess who was standing there! A little girl.
The little girl was so scared that she burst into tears.
This made my dad feel very bad. My mom was mad. She
lifted the little girl onto her knee and gave her an extra big
helping of candy.
Now my poor Monster Dad has to put away his costume
forever. He’ll just have to think of a new trick for
Halloween.
But he had better be careful because Monster Mom will be
watching very closely.
