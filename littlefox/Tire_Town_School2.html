    Tire Town School 17: Tag<br />
    Poppy raced over to Dipper.<br />
    “Tag!” said Poppy. “You're it!”<br />
    Eddy and Jeb laughed.<br />
    The friends were playing tag.<br />
    Poppy drove away fast.<br />
    Dipper shot toward Eddy.<br />
    “Watch out, Eddy!” said Dipper.<br />
    “I'm it!”<br />
    Eddy's tires spun.<br />
    He took off.<br />
    Dipper tagged Jeb.<br />
    Jeb sighed. “I'm it again.”<br />
    “You can't catch me!” Eddy shouted.<br />
    He zoomed away from Jeb.<br />
    Jeb rolled slowly.<br />
    Poppy wasn't looking.<br />
    Jeb tagged her.<br />
    “You're it,” said Jeb.<br />
    “This is so much fun!” said Poppy.<br />
    “I love playing tag!”<br />
    Poppy chased Dipper.<br />
    Dipper got away.<br />
    Poppy chased Eddy.<br />
    Eddy got away.<br />
    Then Eddy saw something.<br />
    “Um, Poppy,” he said.<br />
    “Something is wrong!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 18: Flat Tire<br />
    “Poppy,” said Eddy.<br />
    “You have a flat tire.”<br />
    “I don't care,” said Poppy.<br />
    Thump, thump, thump!<br />
    “Come here, Poppy!” called Ms. Fender.<br />
    “You need a new tire!”<br />
    “I'm okay,” said Poppy.<br />
    “I want to keep playing tag!”<br />
    Thump, thump, thump!<br />
    Poppy chased her friends.<br />
    But she was slow now.<br />
    “Listen to Ms. Fender,” said Eddy.<br />
    “You need a new tire.”<br />
    “Nah,” said Poppy.<br />
    “I'm fine.”<br />
    Poppy drove forward.<br />
    She drove backward.<br />
    Thump, thump, thump.<br />
    “See?” said Poppy.<br />
    “I can still drive.<br />
    Let's keep playing tag!”<br />
    Poppy chased her friends.<br />
    Ms. Fender frowned.<br />
    Poppy tried to tag Eddy.<br />
    But Eddy drove away.<br />
    Then . . .<br />
    “Uh-oh, Poppy!” said Dipper.<br />
    “I see smoke!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 19: Black Smoke<br />
    Puffs of smoke came from Poppy.<br />
    The smoke was gray.<br />
    “Yuck!” said Jeb.<br />
    “That smoke smells terrible!”<br />
    “Poppy!” said Ms. Fender.<br />
    “Come to the garage now.<br />
    You need a repair.”<br />
    “No thanks,” said Poppy.<br />
    “I'm fine!”<br />
    Poppy tried to chase her friends.<br />
    But now Poppy had more smoke.<br />
    The smoke was thick.<br />
    It turned black.<br />
    Eddy coughed.<br />
    Jeb coughed.<br />
    Dipper coughed.<br />
    “Poppy!” called Ms. Fender<br />
    “Come over here!”<br />
    Poppy didn't listen.<br />
    She kept playing.<br />
    Poppy tried to drive fast.<br />
    But she made even more smoke.<br />
    Putt, putt, putt.<br />
    Poppy went slower and slower.<br />
    Finally she rolled to a stop.<br />
    “Uh-oh,” cried Poppy.<br />
    “I'm out of gas!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 20: Out of Gas<br />
    Poppy was out of gas.<br />
    “I can't move!” she said.<br />
    “Uh-oh,” said Eddy.<br />
    Poppy moaned. “This is bad!”<br />
    Ms. Fender drove over.<br />
    “Poppy,” said Ms. Fender.<br />
    “I told you to stop playing.<br />
    You didn't listen!”<br />
    Poppy looked at the ground.<br />
    Jeb pushed her to the garage.<br />
    Everyone followed.<br />
    Ms. Fender put out the smoke.<br />
    She gave Poppy a new tire.<br />
    Then Poppy filled her gas tank.<br />
    “Um, Ms. Fender,” said Poppy.<br />
    “I'm sorry I didn't listen.<br />
    I was busy playing.”<br />
    “I know,” said Ms. Fender.<br />
    “But you can't always play.<br />
    You must take care of yourself.”<br />
    “Okay,” said Poppy.<br />
    Then she raced over to Eddy.<br />
    “Tag!” said Poppy.<br />
    “You're it!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 21: Eddy Is Busy<br />
    The sky was gray.<br />
    A strong wind blew.<br />
    Eddy drove across the parking lot.<br />
    “Hi, Eddy,” said Dipper.<br />
    “Want to play tag?”<br />
    “No, thanks,” said Eddy.<br />
    “I'm busy.”<br />
    Honk! Honk!<br />
    Poppy zoomed over to Eddy.<br />
    “Hey, Eddy!” she said.<br />
    “Want to hear a joke?”<br />
    “Not right now,” said Eddy.<br />
    “I have something to do.”<br />
    Eddy drove past Jeb.<br />
    Jeb was digging.<br />
    “Hi, Eddy,” said Jeb.<br />
    “Want to play in the dirt?”<br />
    “Not now,” said Eddy.<br />
    “I'm busy.”<br />
    Eddy drove onto the racetrack.<br />
    The racetrack was empty.<br />
    It was smooth.<br />
    “I'm alone,” said Eddy.<br />
    “Now I can practice racing!”<br />
    “Hey, slowpoke!” said a voice.<br />
    Eddy groaned.<br />
    It was Zippy.<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 22: The Racetrack<br />
    “Why are you here?” asked Zippy.<br />
    “This is a racetrack.<br />
    It's for speedy cars!”<br />
    “I'm going to practice,” said Eddy.<br />
    “Practice what?” asked Zippy.<br />
    “Racing,” said Eddy.<br />
    Zippy laughed. “I'm fast!<br />
    I don't need to practice!”<br />
    Eddy sighed.<br />
    Then he zoomed down the track.<br />
    “Let's race!” said Zippy.<br />
    “I'm going to win!”<br />
    Zippy shot after Eddy.<br />
    The sky grew dark.<br />
    Raindrops splashed everywhere.<br />
    Eddy's tires slipped in a puddle.<br />
    Eddy slowed down.<br />
    But Zippy went faster.<br />
    Water sprayed off Zippy's tires.<br />
    “Hey, Zippy!” Eddy yelled.<br />
    “You need to slow—”<br />
    Crack!<br />
    Lightning struck a big tree.<br />
    The tree fell onto the racetrack.<br />
    “Slow down, Zippy!” cried Eddy.<br />
    “You're going to crash!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 23: The Slippery Racetrack<br />
    Zippy drove toward the tree.<br />
    He slammed on his brakes.<br />
    But the racetrack was slippery.<br />
    Zippy slid.<br />
    He tried to turn.<br />
    “Oh no!” cried Zippy.<br />
    “I'm going to hit the—”<br />
    Bam!<br />
    Zippy's side banged into the tree.<br />
    “Ouch!” said Zippy.<br />
    “I got a bad dent.”<br />
    Eddy drove slowly.<br />
    He went around the tree.<br />
    He went past Zippy.<br />
    “You were going too fast,” said Eddy.<br />
    Zippy frowned.<br />
    Zoom!<br />
    Zippy shot past Eddy.<br />
    Water splashed on Eddy.<br />
    Then Zippy hit a big puddle.<br />
    He went left.<br />
    He went right.<br />
    Zippy spun in circles.<br />
    “Whoa!” he cried.<br />
    “Oh no!” said Eddy.<br />
    He saw Zippy spin.<br />
    Then Zippy flew off the track!<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 24: Zippy Is Stuck<br />
    Zippy was stuck in a bush.<br />
    “Help!” Zippy cried.<br />
    “I'll get help,” said Eddy.<br />
    Eddy drove slowly back to school.<br />
    Rain fell hard.<br />
    Swish! Swish!<br />
    Eddy's wipers went back and forth.<br />
    Eddy saw Mr. Grill.<br />
    “Eddy!” said Mr. Grill.<br />
    “It's raining hard!<br />
    Where's Zippy?”<br />
    “Zippy is stuck,” said Eddy.<br />
    He led Mr. Grill to Zippy.<br />
    “Please help!” said Zippy.<br />
    “Hold on,” said Mr. Grill.<br />
    Mr. Grill dropped his hook.<br />
    Then he pulled Zippy out.<br />
    “Thanks!” said Zippy.<br />
    They drove back to school.<br />
    Zoom!<br />
    Zippy sped up.<br />
    “Slow down!” called Mr. Grill.<br />
    “Stop right there, Zippy!”<br />
    Eddy drove slowly past Zippy.<br />
    He crossed the finish line first!<br />
    Eddy won the race!<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 25: Black Marks<br />
    Eddy saw long black marks.<br />
    He smelled burnt rubber.<br />
    “Watch this!” Poppy yelled.<br />
    Vroom!<br />
    Poppy drove fast.<br />
    She slammed on her brakes.<br />
    Her wheels stopped.<br />
    But Poppy kept going.<br />
    She skidded across the parking lot.<br />
    Smoke rose from her tires.<br />
    Her tires made more black marks.<br />
    “That was cool!” said Dipper.<br />
    “Now it's my turn!”<br />
    Vroom!<br />
    Dipper raced across the parking lot.<br />
    She slammed on her brakes.<br />
    Dipper skidded.<br />
    “Good one!” said Poppy.<br />
    “Watch me!” Jeb yelled.<br />
    He was at the construction site.<br />
    He rolled down a dirt hill.<br />
    Then he skidded too.<br />
    “It's your turn, Eddy!” said Poppy.<br />
    “You shouldn't skid,” said Eddy.<br />
    “It's bad for your tires!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 26: Skidding<br />
    “We love skidding!” said Poppy.<br />
    “Our tires are fine!” said Dipper.<br />
    Eddy's friends kept skidding.<br />
    “That does look like fun,” Eddy thought.<br />
    “But I'll just watch.”<br />
    More cars and trucks came over.<br />
    “Watch me skid!” yelled a van.<br />
    Vroom!<br />
    The van made a sharp turn.<br />
    She slammed on her brakes.<br />
    The van skidded sideways!<br />
    “Watch this!” cried a jeep.<br />
    He zoomed through the construction site.<br />
    The jeep went up the dirt hill.<br />
    He flew through the air.<br />
    Then he skidded through the dirt.<br />
    Everyone cheered.<br />
    Eddy sighed.<br />
    “Everyone is having fun,” he thought.<br />
    “But skidding is bad for tires.”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 27: Roar!<br />
    Everyone but Eddy was skidding.<br />
    Suddenly Zippy flew by.<br />
    Eddy jumped out of the way.<br />
    Zippy skidded fast across the lot.<br />
    His tires left long dark marks.<br />
    Smoke filled the air.<br />
    “Wow!” said Poppy.<br />
    “That was cool, Zippy!” said the van.<br />
    “I know,” said Zippy.<br />
    Zippy took off again.<br />
    He stopped far away.<br />
    His engine rumbled.<br />
    “Watch this!” Zippy yelled.<br />
    Roar!<br />
    Zippy zoomed back toward everyone.<br />
    He made a sharp turn.<br />
    Then he skidded in circles!<br />
    “Whoa!” said the jeep.<br />
    “Zippy is the best!” said the van.<br />
    “Yes, I am!” said Zippy.<br />
    Suddenly—<br />
    Roar!<br />
    Eddy shot across the parking lot!<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 28: Pop!<br />
    Eddy drove fast.<br />
    “Skidding is bad for tires,” he thought.<br />
    “But it's fun!”<br />
    Eddy jumped over the dirt hill.<br />
    Then he skidded far.<br />
    “Yes!” Eddy cried.<br />
    Everyone cheered.<br />
    Eddy drove off again.<br />
    Zippy followed.<br />
    They both skidded.<br />
    Suddenly—<br />
    Pop!<br />
    “Oh no!” Eddy cried.<br />
    “My tire popped!”<br />
    “Ha-ha!” Zippy laughed.<br />
    “Your tire—”<br />
    Pop!<br />
    “Ugh! My tire popped too!”<br />
    Mr. Grill rushed outside.<br />
    “What's going on?” he cried.<br />
    “We were skidding,” Eddy mumbled.<br />
    “Our tires popped,” said Zippy.<br />
    Mr. Grill frowned.<br />
    “Come with me,” he said.<br />
    Mr. Grill found new tires.<br />
    “No more skidding,” said the teacher.<br />
    “Do you know why?”<br />
    “Yes,” said everyone.<br />
    “It's bad for your tires!”<br />
