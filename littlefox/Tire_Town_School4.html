    Tire Town School 41: Jeb Is Slow<br />
    Eddy and his friends raced.<br />
    They drove around the racetrack.<br />
    “Eddy won!” cried Poppy.<br />
    “Let's race again!” said Eddy.<br />
    “Yeah!” said Dipper.<br />
    “Racing is fun!”<br />
    “You're too fast, Eddy,” said Jeb.<br />
    “You win all the time.”<br />
    “Let's play tag,” said Dipper.<br />
    “I love tag,” said Poppy.<br />
    She tagged Eddy.<br />
    “You're it!” said Poppy.<br />
    She took off.<br />
    Eddy started to follow.<br />
    “I don't like tag,” said Jeb.<br />
    “I'm too slow for it.”<br />
    Poppy and Eddy came back.<br />
    “Hmm,” said Poppy.<br />
    “Let's tell funny jokes.<br />
    Tell a funny joke, Jeb!”<br />
    “Um,” said Jeb.<br />
    “I don't know any funny jokes.”<br />
    Jeb sighed.<br />
    “I'm not really good at anything.”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 42: Snowflakes<br />
    “That's not true, Jeb,” said Poppy.<br />
    “You're good at things.”<br />
    “Not like you, Poppy,” said Jeb.<br />
    “You're funny.<br />
    Eddy is fast.<br />
    And Dipper plays music.”<br />
    “You're good at digging dirt,” said Dipper.<br />
    “I guess,” said Jeb.<br />
    “But no one cares about digging.”<br />
    “I do!” said Eddy.<br />
    “Dirt is fun!”<br />
    Just then a snowflake fell.<br />
    “It's starting to snow!” said Poppy.<br />
    More snowflakes fell.<br />
    “Yay!” cried Poppy.<br />
    Eddy stuck out his tongue.<br />
    He caught a snowflake.<br />
    “Mmm!” said Eddy.<br />
    Soon snow covered the ground.<br />
    The snow got deep.<br />
    “We're going home early!” said Mr. Grill.<br />
    “Yay!” shouted the students.<br />
    Poppy's tires spun in the snow.<br />
    She didn't move.<br />
    “Uh-oh!” said Poppy.<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 43: Deep Snow<br />
    “This snow is deep,” said Poppy.<br />
    “I can't drive in it!”<br />
    “I can't drive either,” said Dipper.<br />
    “I'm stuck!”<br />
    Jeb drove through the snow.<br />
    “I can drive in it,” he said.<br />
    Wind blew.<br />
    It made big snow piles.<br />
    The snow piles blocked the road.<br />
    “Uh-oh,” said Jeb.<br />
    “We can't get to the road.”<br />
    “We're stuck at school!” said Eddy.<br />
    Mr. Grill went into the garage.<br />
    He came out with a snowplow.<br />
    His snowplow pushed the snow.<br />
    Soon the parking lot was clear.<br />
    “We can move now!” said Poppy.<br />
    Mr. Grill pushed the snow piles.<br />
    But the piles were too big.<br />
    Snap!<br />
    “Ugh!” said Mr. Grill.<br />
    “My snowplow broke!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 44: Jeb Helps<br />
    Mr. Grill's plow was broken.<br />
    “Oh no,” said Eddy.<br />
    “This is bad,” said Mr. Grill.<br />
    The snow got deeper.<br />
    The snow piles got bigger.<br />
    “How will we drive home?” said Poppy.<br />
    Jeb rolled over to Mr. Grill.<br />
    “I can help,” said Jeb.<br />
    Mr. Grill smiled.<br />
    “Yes, Jeb!” he said.<br />
    “You have a scooper!”<br />
    Jeb picked up some snow.<br />
    He moved it away.<br />
    Jeb scooped up more snow.<br />
    Soon the snow piles were gone.<br />
    “Way to go, Jeb!” said Eddy.<br />
    “We can get to the road now!”<br />
    A big snowplow truck drove by.<br />
    He was clearing the road.<br />
    He looked at Jeb and nodded.<br />
    “Good job, kid,” said the truck.<br />
    Jeb grinned.<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 45: Parking<br />
    Everyone was learning how to park.<br />
    “Watch me,” said Ms. Fender.<br />
    The teacher drove backward.<br />
    She turned her wheels.<br />
    She parked next to a curb.<br />
    “Everybody, practice,” said Ms. Fender.<br />
    “We have a test this afternoon.”<br />
    Eddy gulped.<br />
    “I don't like tests,” he thought.<br />
    Poppy tried to park.<br />
    Her wheel hit the curb.<br />
    “Oops!” she said.<br />
    “I turned too much!”<br />
    She tried again.<br />
    “Oops!” she said.<br />
    “I didn't turn enough!”<br />
    Eddy backed up.<br />
    He turned.<br />
    He parked next to the curb.<br />
    “Perfect, Eddy,” said Ms. Fender.<br />
    “Wow!” said Jeb.<br />
    “Eddy doesn't need to practice!”<br />
    Zippy laughed.<br />
    “Parking is slow,” he said.<br />
    “That's why Eddy can do it!”<br />
    “Grr!” said Eddy.<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 46: A Great Friend<br />
    Poppy tried to park again.<br />
    She backed up.<br />
    She turned.<br />
    Her wheel hit the curb.<br />
    “Ugh!” cried Poppy.<br />
    “I still can't do this!”<br />
    Zippy laughed.<br />
    Poppy glared at Zippy.<br />
    “Can you park?” she asked.<br />
    “Race cars don't park,” said Zippy.<br />
    “We go fast!”<br />
    Eddy drove over to Poppy.<br />
    “You just need to practice,” he said.<br />
    “But we have a test,” said Poppy.<br />
    “I'm going to fail it!”<br />
    “No, you won't,” said Eddy.<br />
    “I'll help you practice.”<br />
    Poppy smiled.<br />
    “Really?” she asked.<br />
    “Of course,” said Eddy.<br />
    “Story time!” called Ms. Fender.<br />
    Everyone raced over to the teacher.<br />
    “We'll practice during recess,” said Eddy.<br />
    “Thanks, Eddy!” said Poppy.<br />
    “You're a great friend!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 47: Recess Race<br />
    It was time for recess.<br />
    Eddy drove onto the parking lot.<br />
    “Hey, slowpoke!” Zippy yelled.<br />
    Zippy took off.<br />
    “Grr!” said Eddy.<br />
    He raced after the bully.<br />
    Poppy was waiting for Eddy.<br />
    But Eddy didn't see her.<br />
    Eddy chased Zippy around the racetrack.<br />
    They went around and around.<br />
    But Zippy was too fast.<br />
    “Ha-ha!” said Zippy.<br />
    “You're slow!”<br />
    Zippy shot back to the parking lot.<br />
    Eddy sighed.<br />
    “Zippy is a show-off!” he said.<br />
    Eddy drove back to school.<br />
    He turned into the parking lot.<br />
    “Hi, Poppy,” said Eddy.<br />
    Poppy glared at Eddy.<br />
    “Don't say hi to me!” she snapped.<br />
    “You forgot to help me!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 48: Poppy Is Mad<br />
    Eddy raced after Poppy.<br />
    “Poppy, wait!” he cried.<br />
    Eddy shot in front of her.<br />
    “Let's practice now!” he said.<br />
    “No!” said Poppy.<br />
    Poppy backed up fast.<br />
    She tried to go around Eddy.<br />
    Eddy blocked her way.<br />
    Poppy backed up again.<br />
    Poppy turned.<br />
    Then she gasped.<br />
    She was next to the curb.<br />
    “I did it!” cried Poppy.<br />
    “Thanks, Eddy!”<br />
    “You're welcome,” said Eddy.<br />
    “I'm sorry I didn't help before.<br />
    Zippy made me so mad.”<br />
    “It's okay,” said Poppy.<br />
    “Test time!” called Ms. Fender.<br />
    Everyone took the parking test.<br />
    “Yay!” Poppy shouted.<br />
    “I passed the test!”<br />
    Zippy's wheel hit the curb.<br />
    “Ugh,” he said.<br />
    “I failed!”<br />
    Ms. Fender smiled.<br />
    “Keep practicing, Zippy!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School Episode 49: The Junkyard<br />
    Eddy was with his friends.<br />
    They were driving in the woods.<br />
    “This is fun!” Poppy said.<br />
    The road left the woods.<br />
    The friends stopped.<br />
    They saw piles.<br />
    Old wheels sat in one pile.<br />
    Another pile had car doors.<br />
    Everything was rusty.<br />
    “This is a junkyard,” Jeb said.<br />
    “It's a place for old parts.”<br />
    “It's creepy,” Dipper said.<br />
    “It's not creepy,” Jeb said.<br />
    “Let's look around.”<br />
    Jeb rolled off.<br />
    Eddy, Poppy, and Dipper followed.<br />
    They went past some big pipes.<br />
    Dipper drove through an oil puddle.<br />
    “Yuck,” she said.<br />
    “Let's leave,” Dipper said.<br />
    “There might be monsters.”<br />
    “Don't be silly,” Poppy said.<br />
    “There aren't monsters,” Eddy said.<br />
    Brumm, brumm!<br />
    Suddenly they heard a loud sound.<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 50: A Monster?<br />
    “I heard a monster!” Dipper cried.<br />
    “Let's get out of here!”<br />
    “Don't go!” a voice cried.<br />
    “Who said that?” Eddy asked.<br />
    “Look!” Poppy said.<br />
    “Someone is behind that tire pile.”<br />
    A truck peeked out.<br />
    He had really big tires.<br />
    Dipper gasped.<br />
    “A monster!” she cried.<br />
    “Let's go!”<br />
    “Wait!” the truck called.<br />
    “I'm a monster truck.<br />
    But I'm very friendly.”<br />
    Dipper gulped.<br />
    “He looks nice,” she whispered.<br />
    “My name is Gasser,” the truck said.<br />
    “It's nice to meet you, Gasser,” Eddy said.<br />
    “Do you live here?”<br />
    “Yes,” said Gasser.<br />
    “My family just moved here.<br />
    Want to see something cool?”<br />
    Brumm, brumm!<br />
    Gasser sped toward a junk pile.<br />
    “Look out, Gasser!” Eddy cried.<br />
    “You're going to crash!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 51: Playing Games<br />
    Gasser slammed into the junk pile.<br />
    Smash!<br />
    Brumm, brumm!<br />
    Gasser drove over the pile.<br />
    “Whoa!” Eddy said.<br />
    Crack! Crunch!<br />
    Parts twisted and broke.<br />
    Gasser drove up a bigger pile.<br />
    “Yay!” Dipper cheered.<br />
    “Listen to this,” said Gasser.<br />
    He closed his eyes.<br />
    He took a deep breath.<br />
    Brumm, brumm, brumm!<br />
    Gasser's engine roared.<br />
    “Wow!” Eddy said.<br />
    “That was super loud!”<br />
    “Let's play!” Dipper said.<br />
    The friends played hide-and-seek.<br />
    Next they played tag.<br />
    Then they told jokes.<br />
    It was getting late.<br />
    “Good-bye, Gasser,” Eddy said.<br />
    The friends drove home.<br />
    Everyone was sad.<br />
    “Gasser is cool,” Jeb said.<br />
    “Will we ever see him again?”<br />
    <br />
