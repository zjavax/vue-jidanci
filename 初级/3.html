    First Hospital Visit
    Baby Ethan is sick. He has a fever. His mom takes him to
    the Children’s Hospital for the first time.
    There are many children there. All are waiting to see a
    doctor.
    Some children are two or three years old.
    Some are even younger. One baby is just a few weeks
    old. Her dad is carrying her in a basket. She is crying.
    But Ethan is not crying. He is playing with the toys in the
    waiting room.
    “Can I check your ear?”

    A Better Idea
    One day, my sister and I found a coin on the street. I said,
    “Here you take it!” And my sister said, “No. You should
    have it!” But then we saw an old man on the street. “Let‘s
    help some one,” said my sister. We gave the coin to the
    old man. My sister and I looked at each other and smiled.
    We felt very, very good.
    “I have an idea!”

    Grandma’s Chicks
    My grandma loved little chicks. When the salesman came
    to our village with his little chicks, she carefully picked ten
    chicks to bring home.
    Somehow, she had a way of choosing the chicks that
    would grow up to be hens, not roosters.
    We loved to help her take care of the baby chicks too. Day
    by day, the little chicks grew bigger.
    After eight months, they laid their first eggs!
    “Cluck! Cluck!”

    World of Light
    Long ago, people used candles to see at night, but now
    we have electric lights.
    It seems like our whole world is filled with lights. There are
    lights of all colours. There are big lights that light up
    soccer fields, and there are little flashlights too.
    We have so many lights that you can see them from
    space!
    Maybe we should turn out a few lights?
    “What if we turned out some of the lights?”
    3-5
    Our Moon
    Let’s go to the moon! What do we need to take?
    We need to take air to breathe. There is no air on the
    moon. We need to take water to drink. There is no water
    on the moon. We need special clothes too. Why? It is cold
    on the moon.
    When we get there, we will look back to Earth and say,
    “Wow! What a beautiful place we live in.”
    “That’s our beautiful home!”
    3-6
    Bookworm
    Do you know what a bookworm is? Is it a worm that lives
    in a book? Yes. There are worms that like books.
    Can worms read books? Of course not. Bookworms just
    like to eat the paper.
    Bookworm has another meaning. When a person really
    loves reading books, we call that person a bookworm too.
    “I love books!”
    3-7
    Want to Fly?
    Birds can fly. Bees can fly. Many kinds of insects can fly
    too. But people can’t fly.
    Long ago, people tried many ways to fly. But people are
    not birds. People are not insects. What did they do? They
    made a big balloon.
    They put a basket on the balloon. They filled the balloon
    with hot air, and up they went.
    Look! Look way up in the sky. What’s that? It is people
    flying in a hot air balloon.
    “What a beautiful view!”
    3-8
    Teddy
    Teddy is my friend. He is a brown teddy bear.
    He has two big brown eyes. He wears red shoes and a
    blue hat.
    Wherever I go, I take Teddy with me. He sits beside me in
    the car. When I go to sleep at night, I put Teddy beside
    me.
    Teddy is only a toy, but Teddy is really my best friend.
    “Sit tight, Teddy!”
    3-9
    Ladybug
    I am small. I have six legs. I can be red or brown or
    orange. I have black dots on my back. I have wings. I can
    fly. What am I?
    I am a ladybug.
    People say that I bring good luck. If you see a ladybug,
    count the spots on its back. You will have good luck soon.
    Farmers like me a lot. Why? I eat many bad bugs that
    farmers do not like.
    “You’re a famer’s friend.”

    Mr. Fox and the Tree
    Mr. Fox plants a tree in the spring. He takes care of the
    tree, and he even talks to it every day. It makes him smile.
    His friend, Danny, does not understand. “Why are you
    talking to the tree?” asks Danny.
    “I’m helping it grow,” says Mr. Fox.
    “But the tree cannot see or talk.” Danny still doesn’t
    understand.
    “But it can feel. And so can l,” says Mr. Fox.
    “The tree is happy!”

    Crossing the Street
    When Mario came to China for the first time, he couldn’t
    cross the street.
    There were too many cars, buses, and bikes. Even at the
    traffic lights, he was afraid to go.
    Mario was smart. He waited until many other people
    started to go. Then he put himself in the middle of the
    crowd.
    He safely crossed the street.
    “Let’s go fast!”

    Colours of the Rainbow
    See that rainbow in the sky? It’s red, orange, yellow,
    green, blue, indigo, and purple.
    Red on the top, then orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo,
    and then purple at the bottom.
    Every rainbow has these seven colours. These colours
    are always in the same order. Red on the top, purple on
    the bottom.
    “Red, and then orange…”
    3-1 3
    Farm Animals
    I live on a farm. I’m only 8 years old, but I can do many
    things.
    When I get up in the morning, I feed the chickens. I open
    the gate for the sheep. I give the goats water. In the
    afternoon, I gather the eggs and l brush the horses. In the
    evening, I bring the sheep back.
    Once, I saw a baby goat being born. That was amazing! I
    love my life on the farm.
    “Good boy!”

    Easter Egg Hunt
    In Canada, we celebrate a holiday called Easter. It is a
    springtime holiday.
    My sister and I love Easter because we get to go Easter
    egg hunting.
    An Easter egg is chocolate that is shaped like an egg. The
    Easter Bunny hides Easter eggs for us to find. This is
    called an Easter egg hunt.
    It’s a lot of fun!
    “Look! I found one!”

    School Bus-1
    Karen likes the big yellow school bus.
    When Karen sees her sister get on it every morning for
    school, she wants to ride the bus too.
    But her mom says, “Karen, you are too young. You need
    to eat more, sleep more and play more. Then you will
    grow big enough to ride that big school bus.”
    Karen understands. But she wants to be a big girl soon!
    “Bye Karen!”
    3-1 6
    School Bus-2
    From then on, every day, Karen asks her mom, “Am l big
    enough to go to school now?”
    Her mom says, “Not yet.”
    One day, Karen’s mom says, “Karen, you are a big girl
    now. It’s time for you to go to school. Tomorrow, you can
    ride the big yellow school bus with your sister. Are you
    ready?”
    “Yes!” Karen is very excited. Her dream to ride the big
    yellow school bus will come true!
    “Today, you’re coming with me!”

    A Day All Green!
    Today, I see many people wearing green. I see some men
    wearing green hats. I see some girls wearing green skirts
    and some boys wearing green T-shirts. Why?
    My mom tells me that it’s an Irish holiday today. It’s called
    St. Patrick’s Day. Why do they choose the colour green?
    Well, that’s a long story. Mom says she will tell me about it
    later. I can’t wait!
    “Happy St. Patrick’s Day!”
    3-1 8
    All Aboard!
    In school today we learned about a train that travels to the
    “roof of the world”.
    It travels from Beijing to Lhasa, high in the Himalayan
    Mountains.
    That would be the greatest train trip of all. If I had one
    wish, it would be to take that train to the roof of the world.
    What a train ride!
    Imagine the sights and the things I would see!
    “Choo, Choo!”

    The Cat Family
    The cat family is very big. The cute little cats we have in
    our homes are part of this family.
    But there are many other cats in the cat family. Lions are
    cats. Tigers are cats too. Leopards are cats, and so are
    cheetahs.
    Cats can be big or small. They can be fast or slow. They
    can be one colour or they can have spots or stripes on
    them.
    You can see cats all over the world.
    “We are a big cat family.”
    3-20
    The Butterfly
    One day, we were playing outside. Suddenly, a big purple
    butterfly flew over to us.
    “Let’s catch it!” said my sister. We chased the butterfly and
    caught it. It was beautiful. We put it in a cage.
    Soon, the butterfly stopped moving. We realized that the
    butterfly had to go.
    If we kept it in the cage, it would die soon. So we set it
    free and said, “Goodbye butterfly!”
    “You are free, butterfly!”
    3-21
    Zoo Animals
    My class went to the zoo today. It was fun!
    We watched elephants use their trunks. We saw lions rest
    in the sunshine. We watched polar bears swim in the
    water. We saw monkeys climb trees and birds fly through
    the air.
    But best of all, we watched a peacock fan his tail feathers.
    It was so beautiful!
    I want to see that again!
    “Look at me!”
    3-22
    A New Song
    We learned a new song at school today. It’s called “A
    Happy Family”. I can’t wait to sing it at home.
    I love you. You love me.
    We are a happy family.
    With a father, a mother, and a child too.
    Two plus one in our family.
    Do you know how many people are in our family? You
    guessed it!
    There are three people in our family.
    “I learned a new song!”

    Do Worms Sleep?
    Hannah likes worms. She wants to know everything about
    them.
    She asks her mom, “Do worms sleep?”
    Mom says, “I don’t know. Let’s search for the answer.”
    Hannah and her mom read about worms. They learn that
    worms have no arms, no legs, and no eyes. They live in
    the ground and they eat leaves.
    But do they sleep? Yes, they do!
    “Sweet dreams, everyone!”

    Red Toy Car
    Johnny loves his red toy car, but the wheels fell off while
    he was playing. He began to cry.
    His mom gave him a big hug and said, “It’s okay, It’s not
    broken. Look!” She picked up the car and made it fly
    through the air.
    “Now it’s a flying car. The wheels made it too heavy,” said
    his mom.
    Johnny stopped crying and said, “A flying car? Wow!”
    “Now you have a flying car!”

    Cat Adventure-1
    My mom was worried. She had not seen our cat all day,
    but she could hear her meowing.
    We looked all over the house. We looked in the kitchen, in
    the bedroom, and even in the bathroom.
    The whole time we could hear her meowing, but the cat
    wasn’t anywhere in the house.
    Finally, I looked outside and there she was. Our cat was
    on the roof!
    “There she is!”
    3-26
    Cat Adventure-2
    The cat went up to the top of our house!
    Someone left the window open and our cat jumped
    outside and onto the roof.
    It was too high for her to jump back down. Finally, my
    mom climbed up and carried the cat down.
    She said, “You should think about coming down before
    you climb up!”
    “Think about coming down before you jump up!”

    Want an Apple?
    Jack brings his lunch to school every day. His mom makes
    his lunch for him. She puts a sandwich, an apple, and a
    banana in his lunch bag.
    Jack does not like apples. “Who wants this apple?” he
    asks.
    “Me!” his friend Kate says.
    “Here you are!” Jack gives the apple to her.
    “Thanks!” Kate smiles. “One apple a day keeps the doctor
    away,” she says.
    “Apples are good for you.”

    A Rainy Day
    It’s raining again. Mira doesn’t like that. “Why does it have
    to rain?” asks Mira.
    “Without rain, we can’t live!” says her dad.
    “Really?” Mira doesn’t understand.
    “Yes. We would have nothing to eat,” says her dad.
    It is true. Just think about it. The plants need rain to grow.
    The animals need plants to grow.
    Without rain, we would have no food to eat and no water
    to drink.
    “Oh no, it’s raining again.”
    3-29
    Tomato Plants
    In early spring, Uncle Ted planted a few tomato plants in
    his garden.
    A few weeks passed. The plants were still the same.
    Uncle Ted said to me, “My tomato plants are not growing.
    For the last two weeks, they’re just sitting there, waiting.”
    “Waiting?” I asked, “What are they waiting for?”
    My uncle said, “The sun! The heat!”
    “Keep growing, plants!”

    The Cow Didn’t Listen!
    Mr. Lee went to the city with his cow. He followed the
    animal as it crossed the street, not noticing the traffic
    lights.
    “Stop!” A policeman said to them loudly. He started to
    write a ticket.
    Mr. Lee said to his cow, “Stop! Didn’t you hear the
    policeman?”
    But the cow kept moving forward.
    Mr. Lee said. “You see? It’s not me. It’s the cow you
    should give the ticket to.”
    “Here is your ticket!”

    Nature
    Two young people are talking about art.
    “Do you know a great artist?” asks Evan.
    “I think nature is a great artist,” says Emma.
    “Why?” asks her friend Evan.
    “Well, remember seeing the trees in autumn? The leaves
    change into many colours!”
    “Yes, they are really beautiful!” answers Evan.
    “That’s why I think nature is the greatest artist!” says
    Emma.
    “The leaves are beautiful!”
