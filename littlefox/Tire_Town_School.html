    His tires were new.<br />
    His dumper was clean.<br />
    “Oh boy!” said Eddy.<br />
    “My first day of school!”<br />

    “Move!” said a big truck.<br />
    “Sorry!” said Eddy.<br />
    Eddy parked near some tires.<br />
    Fast cars and trucks zoomed by.<br />
    Eddy sighed.<br />
    “I wish I was fast,” he thought.<br />
    “Hello!” called a voice.<br />

    He saw a funny car.<br />
    She had bright colors.<br />
    She had a big grin.<br />
    “I’m Poppy,” said the car.<br />
    “Want to see something funny?”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 2: New Friends<br />
    “Watch this!” said Poppy.<br />
    She took a deep breath.<br />
    Bang!<br />
    Her trunk flew open.<br />
    Balloons flew out!<br />
    Honk! Honk!<br />
    Poppy tooted her horn.<br />
    Eddy laughed hard.<br />
    His dumper shook.<br />
    “What’s your name?” asked Poppy.<br />
    Eddy told her.<br />
    Two trucks rolled over.<br />
    “Eddy,” said Poppy.<br />
    “Meet Dipper and Jeb.”<br />
    “I’m an ice cream truck,” said Dipper.<br />
    “I play music.”<br />
    “I move dirt,” said Jeb.<br />
    He rolled off the lot.<br />
    He scooped some dirt.<br />
    “Hey, Eddy,” said Jeb.<br />
    “Want to carry this dirt?”<br />
    “No, thanks,” said Eddy.<br />
    “I don’t like to carry dirt.”<br />
    Everyone looked surprised.<br />
    “What do you like to do?” asked Dipper.<br />
    Eddy grinned.<br />
    “I like to race!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 3: The Race<br />
    “You like to race?” said Dipper.<br />
    “You must be fast, Eddy!”<br />
    Eddy frowned.<br />
    “I’m slow,” he said.<br />
    “I just wish I was fast.”<br />
    “I bet you’re fast,” said Dipper.<br />
    “Let’s all race!”<br />
    “Okay,” said Eddy.<br />
    “Yay!” said Poppy.<br />
    “This will be fun,” said Jeb.<br />
    Everyone lined up.<br />
    Poppy looked at everyone.<br />
    “Ready, set . . .”<br />
    Honk! Honk!<br />
    Eddy took off.<br />
    Dipper played music.<br />
    Jeb rolled slowly.<br />
    Poppy drove through a puddle.<br />
    “Woo-hoo!” cried Poppy.<br />
    She drove through the puddle again.<br />
    Eddy won!<br />
    “Yay!” His friends cheered.<br />
    “You’re fast!” they said.<br />
    A race car drove over.<br />
    He had fancy stripes.<br />
    “You’re not fast,” said the car.<br />
    “You’re just a slow dump truck!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 4: Crash!<br />
    “You’re mean, Zippy,” said Dipper.<br />
    “Eddy is fast,” said Jeb.<br />
    “He won our race,” said Poppy.<br />
    “Eddy is not fast,” said Zippy.<br />
    “He won because you’re all slow!”<br />
    Eddy felt sad.<br />
    “I’m fast!” said Zippy.<br />
    He zoomed off.<br />
    Vroom! Vroom!<br />
    Zippy turned left.<br />
    He turned right.<br />
    “Wow,” thought Eddy.<br />
    Crash!<br />
    Zippy hit a wall.<br />
    Something rolled across the lot.<br />
    “My wheel!” cried Zippy.<br />
    “I can’t drive now!”<br />
    Zippy looked sad.<br />
    “I’ll help,” said Eddy.<br />
    “Me too,” said Jeb.<br />
    Jeb picked up Zippy’s wheel.<br />
    He put it in Eddy’s dumper.<br />
    Eddy carried the wheel to Zippy.<br />
    “Thanks,” said Zippy.<br />
    “Eddy, let’s race again!” called Poppy.<br />
    Eddy smiled.<br />
    Zippy was mean.<br />
    But Eddy had three new friends!<br />
    <br />
    <br />
    ========================================<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 5: Field Trip<br />
    Eddy saw his friends at school.<br />
    “Hi, Eddy!” called Poppy.<br />
    Honk! Honk!<br />
    She tooted her horn.<br />
    Eddy laughed.<br />
    Poppy was always silly.<br />
    “Field trip today,” said Dipper.<br />
    “Yay!” said Poppy.<br />
    “Where are we going?”<br />
    “Maybe to a construction site,” said Jeb.<br />
    Eddy saw the teacher.<br />
    “Good morning,” said Mr. Grill.<br />
    “Ready for our field trip?”<br />
    “Yes!” said Poppy.<br />
    “Where are we going?” asked Zippy.<br />
    “It’s a surprise,” said Mr. Grill.<br />
    “Everyone, follow me!”<br />
    “Yay!” the students cheered.<br />
    Honk! Honk! Vroom!<br />
    They turned into a parking lot.<br />
    Eddy saw a blue building.<br />
    The building was noisy.<br />
    A sign said Car Wash.<br />
    Mr. Grill smiled.<br />
    “It’s bath time!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 6: The Car Wash<br />
    “The car wash stinks!” said Jeb.<br />
    “This field trip is terrible!”<br />
    The car wash made loud sounds.<br />
    Hiss! Wump! Wump! Wump!<br />
    Poppy was quiet.<br />
    She backed away from the building.<br />
    “Everyone is dirty,” said Mr. Grill.<br />
    “I like dirt,” said Jeb.<br />
    “Dirt feels good,” said Eddy.<br />
    Mr. Grill smiled.<br />
    “I know you like dirt.<br />
    But it’s time to get clean.”<br />
    “I like to be clean,” said Zippy.<br />
    “It helps me go fast!”<br />
    Mr. Grill looked at the students.<br />
    “Who will go first?” he asked.<br />
    Eddy looked at Zippy.<br />
    Then he looked at himself.<br />
    He saw lots of dirt.<br />
    Eddy wanted to be fast.<br />
    He looked at Mr. Grill.<br />
    “I’ll go first,” said Eddy.<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 7: Eddy in the Car Wash<br />
    Eddy drove into the car wash.<br />
    Hiss! Wump! Wump! Wump!<br />
    The building was noisy.<br />
    Water splashed on Eddy.<br />
    “Whoa!” he said.<br />
    Bubbles were everywhere.<br />
    Big brushes spun.<br />
    They cleaned his sides.<br />
    The brushes cleaned Eddy’s top.<br />
    They cleaned his tires.<br />
    Eddy laughed. “That tickles!”<br />
    More water sprayed.<br />
    Suds dripped off Eddy.<br />
    Eddy came out of the car wash.<br />
    “That was fun!” he said.<br />
    “Who will go next?” Mr. Grill asked.<br />
    “Me!” the students shouted.<br />
    Everyone got clean.<br />
    Even Jeb sparkled.<br />
    “I love the car wash!” he said.<br />
    Finally it was Poppy’s turn.<br />
    Poppy frowned.<br />
    “I am not going in there!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 8: Poppy Is Scared<br />
    Poppy looked at the noisy building.<br />
    “I’m not going in,” she said.<br />
    “The car wash is scary!”<br />
    “It’s not scary,” said Mr. Grill.<br />
    “It makes strange sounds,” said Poppy.<br />
    “Ha-ha!” said Zippy.<br />
    “Poppy is afraid!”<br />
    Poppy frowned.<br />
    “The car wash is fun,” said Jeb.<br />
    “It has big brushes.”<br />
    “Brushes aren’t fun,” said Poppy.<br />
    “It sprays you with water,” said Dipper.<br />
    “Hmm,” said Poppy.<br />
    “Water is kind of fun.”<br />
    “There are bubbles,” said Eddy.<br />
    Poppy’s eyes got wide.<br />
    “Bubbles?” she said.<br />
    “I love bubbles!”<br />
    Honk! Honk!<br />
    Poppy raced into the car wash.<br />
    “Woo-hoo!” she cried.<br />
    “This is fun!”<br />
    Everyone went back to school.<br />
    “I love the car wash!” said Poppy.<br />
    “That was the best field trip!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 9: Fast Eddy<br />
    Vroom! Vroom!<br />
    Eddy zoomed around.<br />
    “Way to go, Eddy!” said Jeb.<br />
    “You’re fast!” said Dipper.<br />
    Honk! Honk!<br />
    Poppy tooted her horn.<br />
    Eddy grinned.<br />
    “Someday I’ll be a race car!” he said.<br />
    “No, you won’t,” said Zippy.<br />
    “You’re too slow!”<br />
    Eddy frowned.<br />
    Ms. Fender came outside.<br />
    “Good morning!” said the teacher.<br />
    “It’s time for safety class.”<br />
    “Safety class?” said Zippy.<br />
    “That’s boring!”<br />
    “Safety is important,” said Ms. Fender.<br />
    She led everyone to a track.<br />
    Eddy saw cones.<br />
    He saw stop signs.<br />
    He saw traffic lights.<br />
    “We’ll practice here,” said Ms. Fender.<br />
    “Everyone will drive on the track.<br />
    Don’t go too fast.”<br />
    Zippy laughed.<br />
    “This will be easy for Eddy.<br />
    He’s slow!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 10: Safety Class<br />
    Jeb drove between the cones.<br />
    “Very safe driving!” said Ms. Fender.<br />
    Jeb drove toward a stop sign.<br />
    “Obey the sign,” said Ms. Fender.<br />
    Jeb stopped at the sign.<br />
    He looked both ways.<br />
    Then he drove some more.<br />
    A green light turned yellow.<br />
    Jeb slowed down.<br />
    The light turned red.<br />
    Jeb stopped.<br />
    Zippy whispered to Eddy.<br />
    “You’re good at slowing down.<br />
    Because you’re slow!”<br />
    “I’m not slow,” said Eddy.<br />
    The light turned green.<br />
    Jeb drove some more.<br />
    Soon he was done.<br />
    “Good job,” said Ms. Fender.<br />
    “It’s Zippy’s turn now.”<br />
    Zippy drove to the track.<br />
    Zippy smiled. “This will be easy!”<br />
    “I’m the best at everything!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 11: Not Too Fast<br />
    Zippy drove very fast.<br />
    But he didn’t hit the cones.<br />
    And he stopped at the sign.<br />
    “Good job, Zippy,” said Ms. Fender.<br />
    “But next time go slow.”<br />
    “Sorry,” said Zippy.<br />
    “I’m just too fast!”<br />
    Eddy frowned.<br />
    Poppy went next.<br />
    Honk! Honk!<br />
    Poppy knocked over a cone.<br />
    “Whee!” she cried.<br />
    “Stop being silly, Poppy!” said Ms. Fender.<br />
    “Sorry!” said Poppy.<br />
    “La, la, la, la!” Poppy sang.<br />
    She drove past the stop sign.<br />
    “You didn’t stop!” cried Ms. Fender.<br />
    “Sorry!” said Poppy.<br />
    Then it was Eddy’s turn.<br />
    “Remember, Eddy,” said Ms. Fender.<br />
    “Don’t go too fast.”<br />
    Zippy laughed. “Don’t worry, Ms. Fender.<br />
    Eddy won’t go too fast!”<br />
    Eddy’s engine roared.<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 12: Eddy Is Not Safe<br />
    Eddy drove onto the track.<br />
    “Slow, slow, slow!” Zippy sang.<br />
    Eddy gritted his teeth.<br />
    Eddy drove between the cones.<br />
    He saw the stop sign.<br />
    Eddy slowed down.<br />
    “You are really slow!” Zippy laughed.<br />
    Eddy felt hot.<br />
    His dumper shook.<br />
    “I’m not slow!” Eddy yelled.<br />
    Vroom!<br />
    Eddy went fast—too fast!<br />
    “Slow down!” cried Ms. Fender.<br />
    Eddy flew past a red light.<br />
    He crashed into cones.<br />
    “That was not safe!” said Ms. Fender.<br />
    Eddy sighed. “I’m sorry.”<br />
    “Zippy,” said Ms. Fender.<br />
    “You must stop being a bully.”<br />
    “Fine,” Zippy said.<br />
    Eddy drove on the track again.<br />
    “Eddy is slow,” said Zippy.<br />
    “No! Eddy is safe!” said Ms. Fender.<br />
    Everyone honked.<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 13: Something New<br />
    “Good morning,” said Mr. Grill.<br />
    “We will do something new today!”<br />
    “Will we go fast?” asked Zippy.<br />
    He looked at Eddy and grinned.<br />
    Eddy frowned.<br />
    “Will we tell jokes?” asked Poppy.<br />
    “Nope,” said Mr. Grill.<br />
    “Follow me!”<br />
    The teacher drove down the road.<br />
    Eddy saw lots of trees.<br />
    “Hmm,” he thought.<br />
    “Where are we going?”<br />
    “We’re here!” said Mr. Grill.<br />
    Eddy saw a wide path.<br />
    It led into the woods.<br />
    Mr. Grill smiled.<br />
    “We’re going off-road!”<br />
    Eddy smiled.<br />
    “Wow!” he said.<br />
    “Cool!” said Jeb.<br />
    “Fun!” said Dipper.<br />
    “Yay!” said Poppy.<br />
    “I hope the path is bumpy!”<br />
    Zippy frowned.<br />
    “This stinks!” he cried.<br />
    “I hate going off-road!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 14: The Dirt Path<br />
    Eddy smiled.<br />
    “I love driving off-road.<br />
    Dirt and rocks feel good!”<br />
    Poppy tooted her horn.<br />
    Honk! Honk!<br />
    “Ugh,” said Zippy.<br />
    “I have to drive slowly.<br />
    And I’ll get dirty.”<br />
    “You’ll be fine, Zippy,” said Mr. Grill.<br />
    Everyone drove into the woods.<br />
    The path had lots of rocks.<br />
    Jeb rolled over the rocks.<br />
    Dipper drove around them.<br />
    Poppy bumped up and down.<br />
    “Whee!” she said.<br />
    “This is fun!” said Eddy.<br />
    He rolled over a big rock.<br />
    A tree branch hit Zippy.<br />
    “Oof!” he said.<br />
    His tire hit a rock.<br />
    “Ouch!” said Zippy.<br />
    “Everybody, get ready!” said Mr. Grill.<br />
    “The path gets muddy soon!”<br />
    “Yay!” shouted everyone.<br />
    “Ugh!” moaned Zippy.<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 15: Mud<br />
    Zippy did not like dirt paths.<br />
    He did not like rocks.<br />
    “This stinks,” said Zippy.<br />
    “I have to drive slowly.<br />
    And these rocks hurt!”<br />
    Eddy grinned.<br />
    Now he was faster than Zippy!<br />
    “I see mud!” cried Poppy.<br />
    Everybody drove through the mud.<br />
    “Oh no!” said Zippy.<br />
    “My tires are muddy!”<br />
    Eddy went fast in the mud.<br />
    The mud splashed.<br />
    Splat!<br />
    Mud sprayed all over Zippy.<br />
    “Hey!” cried Zippy.<br />
    Poppy splashed in the mud.<br />
    Splat!<br />
    “Ugh!” cried Zippy.<br />
    Jeb and Dipper splashed in the mud.<br />
    Splat! Splat!<br />
    Zippy spun his tires.<br />
    But the mud was deep.<br />
    His tires went deeper.<br />
    “Oh no!” cried Zippy.<br />
    “I’m stuck in the mud!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 16: Deep Mud<br />
    Zippy spun his tires.<br />
    He spun them very fast.<br />
    Mud sprayed everywhere.<br />
    But Zippy didn’t move.<br />
    Zippy sank deeper.<br />
    “Help!” he cried.<br />
    “I’ll help you,” said Mr. Grill.<br />
    The teacher pushed.<br />
    Zippy moved a little bit.<br />
    But then Mr. Grill sank too.<br />
    “Help!” he cried.<br />
    “Uh-oh!” said Dipper.<br />
    Poppy gulped.<br />
    Eddy looked at Jeb.<br />
    Jeb looked at Eddy.<br />
    “Let’s clear that mud,” said Eddy.<br />
    The two friends moved fast.<br />
    Shloomp!<br />
    Jeb scooped the mud.<br />
    He put it in Eddy’s dumper.<br />
    Soon everyone was free!<br />
    “Thank you,” said Mr. Grill.<br />
    “You’re welcome,” said Eddy and Jeb.<br />
    Eddy zoomed along the path.<br />
    “I love driving off-road!”<br />
    Zippy groaned. “I don’t!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 17: Tag<br />
    Poppy raced over to Dipper.<br />
    “Tag!” said Poppy. “You’re it!”<br />
    Eddy and Jeb laughed.<br />
    The friends were playing tag.<br />
    Poppy drove away fast.<br />
    Dipper shot toward Eddy.<br />
    “Watch out, Eddy!” said Dipper.<br />
    “I’m it!”<br />
    Eddy’s tires spun.<br />
    He took off.<br />
    Dipper tagged Jeb.<br />
    Jeb sighed. “I’m it again.”<br />
    “You can’t catch me!” Eddy shouted.<br />
    He zoomed away from Jeb.<br />
    Jeb rolled slowly.<br />
    Poppy wasn’t looking.<br />
    Jeb tagged her.<br />
    “You’re it,” said Jeb.<br />
    “This is so much fun!” said Poppy.<br />
    “I love playing tag!”<br />
    Poppy chased Dipper.<br />
    Dipper got away.<br />
    Poppy chased Eddy.<br />
    Eddy got away.<br />
    Then Eddy saw something.<br />
    “Um, Poppy,” he said.<br />
    “Something is wrong!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 18: Flat Tire<br />
    “Poppy,” said Eddy.<br />
    “You have a flat tire.”<br />
    “I don’t care,” said Poppy.<br />
    Thump, thump, thump!<br />
    “Come here, Poppy!” called Ms. Fender.<br />
    “You need a new tire!”<br />
    “I’m okay,” said Poppy.<br />
    “I want to keep playing tag!”<br />
    Thump, thump, thump!<br />
    Poppy chased her friends.<br />
    But she was slow now.<br />
    “Listen to Ms. Fender,” said Eddy.<br />
    “You need a new tire.”<br />
    “Nah,” said Poppy.<br />
    “I’m fine.”<br />
    Poppy drove forward.<br />
    She drove backward.<br />
    Thump, thump, thump.<br />
    “See?” said Poppy.<br />
    “I can still drive.<br />
    Let’s keep playing tag!”<br />
    Poppy chased her friends.<br />
    Ms. Fender frowned.<br />
    Poppy tried to tag Eddy.<br />
    But Eddy drove away.<br />
    Then . . .<br />
    “Uh-oh, Poppy!” said Dipper.<br />
    “I see smoke!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 19: Black Smoke<br />
    Puffs of smoke came from Poppy.<br />
    The smoke was gray.<br />
    “Yuck!” said Jeb.<br />
    “That smoke smells terrible!”<br />
    “Poppy!” said Ms. Fender.<br />
    “Come to the garage now.<br />
    You need a repair.”<br />
    “No thanks,” said Poppy.<br />
    “I’m fine!”<br />
    Poppy tried to chase her friends.<br />
    But now Poppy had more smoke.<br />
    The smoke was thick.<br />
    It turned black.<br />
    Eddy coughed.<br />
    Jeb coughed.<br />
    Dipper coughed.<br />
    “Poppy!” called Ms. Fender<br />
    “Come over here!”<br />
    Poppy didn’t listen.<br />
    She kept playing.<br />
    Poppy tried to drive fast.<br />
    But she made even more smoke.<br />
    Putt, putt, putt.<br />
    Poppy went slower and slower.<br />
    Finally she rolled to a stop.<br />
    “Uh-oh,” cried Poppy.<br />
    “I’m out of gas!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 20: Out of Gas<br />
    Poppy was out of gas.<br />
    “I can’t move!” she said.<br />
    “Uh-oh,” said Eddy.<br />
    Poppy moaned. “This is bad!”<br />
    Ms. Fender drove over.<br />
    “Poppy,” said Ms. Fender.<br />
    “I told you to stop playing.<br />
    You didn’t listen!”<br />
    Poppy looked at the ground.<br />
    Jeb pushed her to the garage.<br />
    Everyone followed.<br />
    Ms. Fender put out the smoke.<br />
    She gave Poppy a new tire.<br />
    Then Poppy filled her gas tank.<br />
    “Um, Ms. Fender,” said Poppy.<br />
    “I’m sorry I didn’t listen.<br />
    I was busy playing.”<br />
    “I know,” said Ms. Fender.<br />
    “But you can’t always play.<br />
    You must take care of yourself.”<br />
    “Okay,” said Poppy.<br />
    Then she raced over to Eddy.<br />
    “Tag!” said Poppy.<br />
    “You’re it!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 21: Eddy Is Busy<br />
    The sky was gray.<br />
    A strong wind blew.<br />
    Eddy drove across the parking lot.<br />
    “Hi, Eddy,” said Dipper.<br />
    “Want to play tag?”<br />
    “No, thanks,” said Eddy.<br />
    “I’m busy.”<br />
    Honk! Honk!<br />
    Poppy zoomed over to Eddy.<br />
    “Hey, Eddy!” she said.<br />
    “Want to hear a joke?”<br />
    “Not right now,” said Eddy.<br />
    “I have something to do.”<br />
    Eddy drove past Jeb.<br />
    Jeb was digging.<br />
    “Hi, Eddy,” said Jeb.<br />
    “Want to play in the dirt?”<br />
    “Not now,” said Eddy.<br />
    “I’m busy.”<br />
    Eddy drove onto the racetrack.<br />
    The racetrack was empty.<br />
    It was smooth.<br />
    “I’m alone,” said Eddy.<br />
    “Now I can practice racing!”<br />
    “Hey, slowpoke!” said a voice.<br />
    Eddy groaned.<br />
    It was Zippy.<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 22: The Racetrack<br />
    “Why are you here?” asked Zippy.<br />
    “This is a racetrack.<br />
    It’s for speedy cars!”<br />
    “I’m going to practice,” said Eddy.<br />
    “Practice what?” asked Zippy.<br />
    “Racing,” said Eddy.<br />
    Zippy laughed. “I’m fast!<br />
    I don’t need to practice!”<br />
    Eddy sighed.<br />
    Then he zoomed down the track.<br />
    “Let’s race!” said Zippy.<br />
    “I’m going to win!”<br />
    Zippy shot after Eddy.<br />
    The sky grew dark.<br />
    Raindrops splashed everywhere.<br />
    Eddy’s tires slipped in a puddle.<br />
    Eddy slowed down.<br />
    But Zippy went faster.<br />
    Water sprayed off Zippy’s tires.<br />
    “Hey, Zippy!” Eddy yelled.<br />
    “You need to slow—”<br />
    Crack!<br />
    Lightning struck a big tree.<br />
    The tree fell onto the racetrack.<br />
    “Slow down, Zippy!” cried Eddy.<br />
    “You’re going to crash!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 23: The Slippery Racetrack<br />
    Zippy drove toward the tree.<br />
    He slammed on his brakes.<br />
    But the racetrack was slippery.<br />
    Zippy slid.<br />
    He tried to turn.<br />
    “Oh no!” cried Zippy.<br />
    “I’m going to hit the—”<br />
    Bam!<br />
    Zippy’s side banged into the tree.<br />
    “Ouch!” said Zippy.<br />
    “I got a bad dent.”<br />
    Eddy drove slowly.<br />
    He went around the tree.<br />
    He went past Zippy.<br />
    “You were going too fast,” said Eddy.<br />
    Zippy frowned.<br />
    Zoom!<br />
    Zippy shot past Eddy.<br />
    Water splashed on Eddy.<br />
    Then Zippy hit a big puddle.<br />
    He went left.<br />
    He went right.<br />
    Zippy spun in circles.<br />
    “Whoa!” he cried.<br />
    “Oh no!” said Eddy.<br />
    He saw Zippy spin.<br />
    Then Zippy flew off the track!<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 24: Zippy Is Stuck<br />
    Zippy was stuck in a bush.<br />
    “Help!” Zippy cried.<br />
    “I’ll get help,” said Eddy.<br />
    Eddy drove slowly back to school.<br />
    Rain fell hard.<br />
    Swish! Swish!<br />
    Eddy’s wipers went back and forth.<br />
    Eddy saw Mr. Grill.<br />
    “Eddy!” said Mr. Grill.<br />
    “It’s raining hard!<br />
    Where’s Zippy?”<br />
    “Zippy is stuck,” said Eddy.<br />
    He led Mr. Grill to Zippy.<br />
    “Please help!” said Zippy.<br />
    “Hold on,” said Mr. Grill.<br />
    Mr. Grill dropped his hook.<br />
    Then he pulled Zippy out.<br />
    “Thanks!” said Zippy.<br />
    They drove back to school.<br />
    Zoom!<br />
    Zippy sped up.<br />
    “Slow down!” called Mr. Grill.<br />
    “Stop right there, Zippy!”<br />
    Eddy drove slowly past Zippy.<br />
    He crossed the finish line first!<br />
    Eddy won the race!<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 25: Black Marks<br />
    Eddy saw long black marks.<br />
    He smelled burnt rubber.<br />
    “Watch this!” Poppy yelled.<br />
    Vroom!<br />
    Poppy drove fast.<br />
    She slammed on her brakes.<br />
    Her wheels stopped.<br />
    But Poppy kept going.<br />
    She skidded across the parking lot.<br />
    Smoke rose from her tires.<br />
    Her tires made more black marks.<br />
    “That was cool!” said Dipper.<br />
    “Now it’s my turn!”<br />
    Vroom!<br />
    Dipper raced across the parking lot.<br />
    She slammed on her brakes.<br />
    Dipper skidded.<br />
    “Good one!” said Poppy.<br />
    “Watch me!” Jeb yelled.<br />
    He was at the construction site.<br />
    He rolled down a dirt hill.<br />
    Then he skidded too.<br />
    “It’s your turn, Eddy!” said Poppy.<br />
    “You shouldn’t skid,” said Eddy.<br />
    “It’s bad for your tires!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 26: Skidding<br />
    “We love skidding!” said Poppy.<br />
    “Our tires are fine!” said Dipper.<br />
    Eddy’s friends kept skidding.<br />
    “That does look like fun,” Eddy thought.<br />
    “But I’ll just watch.”<br />
    More cars and trucks came over.<br />
    “Watch me skid!” yelled a van.<br />
    Vroom!<br />
    The van made a sharp turn.<br />
    She slammed on her brakes.<br />
    The van skidded sideways!<br />
    “Watch this!” cried a jeep.<br />
    He zoomed through the construction site.<br />
    The jeep went up the dirt hill.<br />
    He flew through the air.<br />
    Then he skidded through the dirt.<br />
    Everyone cheered.<br />
    Eddy sighed.<br />
    “Everyone is having fun,” he thought.<br />
    “But skidding is bad for tires.”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 27: Roar!<br />
    Everyone but Eddy was skidding.<br />
    Suddenly Zippy flew by.<br />
    Eddy jumped out of the way.<br />
    Zippy skidded fast across the lot.<br />
    His tires left long dark marks.<br />
    Smoke filled the air.<br />
    “Wow!” said Poppy.<br />
    “That was cool, Zippy!” said the van.<br />
    “I know,” said Zippy.<br />
    Zippy took off again.<br />
    He stopped far away.<br />
    His engine rumbled.<br />
    “Watch this!” Zippy yelled.<br />
    Roar!<br />
    Zippy zoomed back toward everyone.<br />
    He made a sharp turn.<br />
    Then he skidded in circles!<br />
    “Whoa!” said the jeep.<br />
    “Zippy is the best!” said the van.<br />
    “Yes, I am!” said Zippy.<br />
    Suddenly—<br />
    Roar!<br />
    Eddy shot across the parking lot!<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 28: Pop!<br />
    Eddy drove fast.<br />
    “Skidding is bad for tires,” he thought.<br />
    “But it’s fun!”<br />
    Eddy jumped over the dirt hill.<br />
    Then he skidded far.<br />
    “Yes!” Eddy cried.<br />
    Everyone cheered.<br />
    Eddy drove off again.<br />
    Zippy followed.<br />
    They both skidded.<br />
    Suddenly—<br />
    Pop!<br />
    “Oh no!” Eddy cried.<br />
    “My tire popped!”<br />
    “Ha-ha!” Zippy laughed.<br />
    “Your tire—”<br />
    Pop!<br />
    “Ugh! My tire popped too!”<br />
    Mr. Grill rushed outside.<br />
    “What’s going on?” he cried.<br />
    “We were skidding,” Eddy mumbled.<br />
    “Our tires popped,” said Zippy.<br />
    Mr. Grill frowned.<br />
    “Come with me,” he said.<br />
    Mr. Grill found new tires.<br />
    “No more skidding,” said the teacher.<br />
    “Do you know why?”<br />
    “Yes,” said everyone.<br />
    “It’s bad for your tires!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 29: The Plan<br />
    Roar!<br />
    Eddy’s engine started.<br />
    His tires spun.<br />
    And he took off!<br />
    Vroom!<br />
    Eddy zoomed across the parking lot.<br />
    “Go, Eddy!” Poppy cheered.<br />
    “Woo-hoo!”<br />
    “Eddy looks fast today!” said Jeb.<br />
    “Yes!” said Dipper.<br />
    Mr. Grill came outside.<br />
    “Time for class!” he said.<br />
    Eddy drove over.<br />
    Everyone parked near the teacher.<br />
    “Good morning, Mr. Grill,” they said.<br />
    “What’s the plan today?” asked Dipper.<br />
    “Is there a field trip?”<br />
    “No,” said Mr. Grill.<br />
    “Will we go fast?” asked Zippy.<br />
    “No,” said Mr. Grill.<br />
    “What will we do?” asked Poppy.<br />
    Mr. Grill smiled.<br />
    “We will stop,” he said.<br />
    “Stop?” cried Zippy.<br />
    “That’s right,” said Mr. Grill.<br />
    “Today we’ll use our brakes!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 30: Brakes Are Boring<br />
    “Brakes?” cried Zippy.<br />
    “Brakes are boring!”<br />
    Eddy didn’t like Zippy.<br />
    But Zippy was right.<br />
    Brakes were boring.<br />
    “Brakes are very important,” said Mr. Grill.<br />
    “First we must check them.”<br />
    The teacher drove slowly.<br />
    Then he stopped.<br />
    “See?” he said.<br />
    “My brakes work.<br />
    Now you all try.”<br />
    Most students checked their brakes.<br />
    But Zippy didn’t.<br />
    “My brakes are fine,” said Zippy.<br />
    “I don’t need to check them.”<br />
    Mr. Grill drove around the parking lot.<br />
    “Use brakes when you turn,” he said.<br />
    Mr. Grill slowed down.<br />
    He made a turn.<br />
    Then he went faster.<br />
    “Ugh,” said Zippy.<br />
    “Race cars never slow down.”<br />
    “Yeah!” said Eddy.<br />
    “I won’t check my brakes either.”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 31: No Brakes!<br />
    Eddy was at the racetrack.<br />
    Roar!<br />
    Eddy took off!<br />
    There was a bend in the track.<br />
    Eddy didn’t slow down.<br />
    He shot around the bend.<br />
    But then he slid.<br />
    “Whoa!” cried Eddy.<br />
    “I almost crashed!”<br />
    There was another bend.<br />
    “I’ll slow down this time,” he thought.<br />
    Eddy hit his brakes.<br />
    But they didn’t work.<br />
    Crash!<br />
    “Ouch!” cried Eddy.<br />
    Eddy rolled slowly to the garage.<br />
    Mr. Grill fixed his brakes.<br />
    Later Eddy was in the parking lot.<br />
    “Let’s play tag!” said Poppy.<br />
    Eddy roared his engine .<br />
    He started to drive.<br />
    But then he remembered the crash.<br />
    Eddy stopped.<br />
    “I’m scared to go fast!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 32: Playing in the Dirt<br />
    Eddy drove to the construction site.<br />
    He went slowly.<br />
    He didn’t want to crash again.<br />
    “Hey, Jeb,” said Eddy.<br />
    “Let’s play in the dirt!”<br />
    Poppy and Dipper drove over.<br />
    “Eddy!” said Poppy.<br />
    “Don’t you want to play tag?”<br />
    “No,” said Eddy.<br />
    “I don’t want to crash again.”<br />
    Jeb loaded dirt into Eddy’s dumper.<br />
    Eddy dumped the dirt.<br />
    “You won’t crash,” said Dipper.<br />
    “Don’t you want to go fast?”<br />
    “No,” said Eddy.<br />
    Zippy drove over.<br />
    “Hey, slowpoke!” he said.<br />
    “Want to race?”<br />
    “Grr!” said Eddy.<br />
    “Leave Eddy alone,” said Dipper.<br />
    “He doesn’t want to—”<br />
    Roar!<br />
    Eddy roared his engine.<br />
    He quickly checked his brakes.<br />
    Then he took off!<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 33: Up, Up, Up!<br />
    “I love field trips,” said Eddy.<br />
    “The new bridge will be cool.<br />
    I can’t wait to see it!”<br />
    Everyone drove up a hill.<br />
    “This hill is steep!” said Poppy.<br />
    “I’m tired,” said Jeb.<br />
    “Me too,” said Dipper.<br />
    “I’m too tired to play music.”<br />
    “Up, up, up!” said Ms. Fender.<br />
    “We’re almost there!”<br />
    “Ugh!” said Zippy.<br />
    Eddy saw mountains .<br />
    He felt the wind.<br />
    “Wow!” he said.<br />
    “Keep going, everyone!” said Ms. Fender.<br />
    “The new bridge is close!”<br />
    The road made a sharp turn.<br />
    Then Eddy saw something red.<br />
    “Whoa!” said Eddy.<br />
    “The new bridge!”<br />
    Ms. Fender smiled.<br />
    “Here we are!” she said.<br />
    “Who will go across first?”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 34: The New Bridge<br />
    Eddy looked at the new bridge.<br />
    “Oh boy!” he said.<br />
    He drove closer.<br />
    Eddy looked up.<br />
    He saw clouds.<br />
    Then Eddy looked down.<br />
    The ground was far below.<br />
    There was a river.<br />
    It looked tiny.<br />
    Eddy gulped.<br />
    “We’re up very high!” he thought.<br />
    “Who’s going first?” Ms. Fender asked.<br />
    “Not me!” said Dipper.<br />
    “Not me!” said Jeb.<br />
    “Not me!” said Poppy.<br />
    “The bridge is too high!”<br />
    “Don’t be scared,” said Ms. Fender.<br />
    “The bridge is very safe.”<br />
    Then Ms. Fender saw Eddy.<br />
    “Oh, Eddy!” said Ms. Fender.<br />
    “You don’t seem scared.<br />
    Do you want to go first?”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 35: Eddy Is Brave<br />
    Eddy was scared.<br />
    The bridge was too high!<br />
    “Go ahead, Eddy!” said Ms. Fender.<br />
    “Drive across the bridge.”<br />
    Eddy backed up a little.<br />
    “Go, Eddy!” Poppy cheered.<br />
    “You can do it!”<br />
    “Eddy is brave!” said Dipper.<br />
    “He’s braver than we are!” said Jeb.<br />
    Zippy laughed.<br />
    “Eddy is not brave.<br />
    He’s scared!”<br />
    Eddy felt hot all over.<br />
    “I’m not scared!” he yelled.<br />
    “Oh yeah?” said Zippy.<br />
    “Then cross the bridge.”<br />
    “Fine,” said Eddy.<br />
    “I will!”<br />
    Eddy took a deep breath.<br />
    He rolled onto the bridge.<br />
    Eddy drove very slowly.<br />
    “I can be brave,” he thought.<br />
    “I just won’t look down.”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 36: Across the Bridge<br />
    Eddy was on the bridge.<br />
    “This bridge isn’t scary,” he thought.<br />
    Some birds flew by.<br />
    “Birds aren’t scary,” Eddy thought.<br />
    A wind blew.<br />
    “Wind isn’t scary,” Eddy thought.<br />
    Then a stronger wind blew.<br />
    The bridge shook!<br />
    “Ahh!” Eddy screamed.<br />
    He spun his tires.<br />
    And he shot across the bridge!<br />
    Eddy stopped on the other side.<br />
    “Whew!” said Eddy.<br />
    “I’m safe!”<br />
    Eddy looked back.<br />
    Poppy drove onto the bridge.<br />
    Everyone else followed Poppy.<br />
    Soon everyone was on Eddy’s side.<br />
    “Thanks, Eddy,” said Poppy.<br />
    “You were very brave.<br />
    You made us brave!”<br />
    “Well done, Eddy,” said Ms. Fender.<br />
    Eddy grinned.<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 37: The Racing Team<br />
    “I have some news,” said Mr. Grill.<br />
    “I’m forming a racing team.”<br />
    “What?” cried Eddy.<br />
    “Really?” said Zippy.<br />
    “Tryouts are next week,” said Mr. Grill.<br />
    “I’ll pick the fastest cars.<br />
    They’ll get team stickers.”<br />
    “Oh boy!” said Eddy.<br />
    “I hope I make the team.”<br />
    “You will,” said Poppy.<br />
    “You’re fast,” said Jeb.<br />
    “We’ll help you train,” said Dipper.<br />
    Eddy trained all week.<br />
    He drove faster each day.<br />
    His friends cheered him on.<br />
    “Go, Eddy!” said Jeb.<br />
    Zippy flew by Eddy.<br />
    “Ha-ha!” said Zippy.<br />
    “Eddy won’t make the team!”<br />
    Eddy stopped.<br />
    “Don’t listen to Zippy,” said Poppy.<br />
    “You’ll make the team.”<br />
    Eddy sighed.<br />
    “I hope you’re right.”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 38: Tryouts<br />
    It was the day of tryouts.<br />
    Eddy saw Zippy.<br />
    He saw other cars too.<br />
    They all looked pretty fast.<br />
    “Welcome to tryouts,” said Mr. Grill.<br />
    “I need four fast racers.”<br />
    “How will you pick them?” Zippy asked.<br />
    “We’ll have a race,” said Mr. Grill.<br />
    “I’ll pick the four winners.”<br />
    “Me!” said Zippy.<br />
    “Maybe,” said Mr. Grill.<br />
    “Everyone, line up.”<br />
    Eddy went to the starting line.<br />
    He was between two big cars.<br />
    Their engines rumbled.<br />
    Eddy gulped.<br />
    But then he heard his friends.<br />
    “You can do it, Eddy!” Poppy shouted.<br />
    “Good luck, everyone,” said Mr. Grill.<br />
    “Ready, set . . . go!”<br />
    Eddy took off.<br />
    “I can do this,” he thought.<br />
    “I can make the team!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 39: Stickers<br />
    Eddy raced.<br />
    Most cars flew ahead of Eddy.<br />
    But some cars were behind him.<br />
    “At least I’m not last,” Eddy thought.<br />
    Then Eddy passed a car.<br />
    “Cool!” said Eddy.<br />
    Vroom!<br />
    Eddy picked up speed.<br />
    He went around the bend.<br />
    Eddy passed another car.<br />
    Then he passed another.<br />
    “Wow!” said Eddy.<br />
    “I really am fast!<br />
    I’m going to make the team!”<br />
    Eddy saw the finish line.<br />
    He raced across it.<br />
    “I won!” Zippy was shouting.<br />
    Eddy looked over.<br />
    Three other cars were with Zippy.<br />
    They all had team stickers.<br />
    “The four winners,” thought Eddy.<br />
    “Sorry, Eddy,” said Mr. Grill.<br />
    “You were pretty fast.<br />
    But you didn’t make the team.”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 40: The Best Team Ever<br />
    Eddy drove toward his friends.<br />
    He felt awful.<br />
    Zippy flew past Eddy.<br />
    “I made the team!” Zippy shouted.<br />
    “And Eddy didn’t!”<br />
    Poppy looked at Eddy.<br />
    She whispered to Dipper and Jeb.<br />
    The three of them raced away.<br />
    They drove behind the garage.<br />
    Eddy gasped.<br />
    “My friends don’t like me anymore!” he thought.<br />
    Eddy grew angry.<br />
    “They’re mean!” he thought.<br />
    “I’ll tell them that!”<br />
    Eddy drove behind the garage.<br />
    “Surprise!” shouted Poppy.<br />
    “Huh?” said Eddy.<br />
    Poppy stuck a sticker on Eddy.<br />
    “There!” she said.<br />
    “Now you’re on a team!”<br />
    “What team?” asked Eddy.<br />
    “Our team!” said Dipper.<br />
    “It’s a friends’ team!” said Jeb.<br />
    Eddy grinned.<br />
    It was the best team ever.<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 41: Jeb Is Slow<br />
    Eddy and his friends raced.<br />
    They drove around the racetrack.<br />
    “Eddy won!” cried Poppy.<br />
    “Let’s race again!” said Eddy.<br />
    “Yeah!” said Dipper.<br />
    “Racing is fun!”<br />
    “You’re too fast, Eddy,” said Jeb.<br />
    “You win all the time.”<br />
    “Let’s play tag,” said Dipper.<br />
    “I love tag,” said Poppy.<br />
    She tagged Eddy.<br />
    “You’re it!” said Poppy.<br />
    She took off.<br />
    Eddy started to follow.<br />
    “I don’t like tag,” said Jeb.<br />
    “I’m too slow for it.”<br />
    Poppy and Eddy came back.<br />
    “Hmm,” said Poppy.<br />
    “Let’s tell funny jokes.<br />
    Tell a funny joke, Jeb!”<br />
    “Um,” said Jeb.<br />
    “I don’t know any funny jokes.”<br />
    Jeb sighed.<br />
    “I’m not really good at anything.”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 42: Snowflakes<br />
    “That’s not true, Jeb,” said Poppy.<br />
    “You’re good at things.”<br />
    “Not like you, Poppy,” said Jeb.<br />
    “You’re funny.<br />
    Eddy is fast.<br />
    And Dipper plays music.”<br />
    “You’re good at digging dirt,” said Dipper.<br />
    “I guess,” said Jeb.<br />
    “But no one cares about digging.”<br />
    “I do!” said Eddy.<br />
    “Dirt is fun!”<br />
    Just then a snowflake fell.<br />
    “It’s starting to snow!” said Poppy.<br />
    More snowflakes fell.<br />
    “Yay!” cried Poppy.<br />
    Eddy stuck out his tongue.<br />
    He caught a snowflake.<br />
    “Mmm!” said Eddy.<br />
    Soon snow covered the ground.<br />
    The snow got deep.<br />
    “We’re going home early!” said Mr. Grill.<br />
    “Yay!” shouted the students.<br />
    Poppy’s tires spun in the snow.<br />
    She didn’t move.<br />
    “Uh-oh!” said Poppy.<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 43: Deep Snow<br />
    “This snow is deep,” said Poppy.<br />
    “I can’t drive in it!”<br />
    “I can’t drive either,” said Dipper.<br />
    “I’m stuck!”<br />
    Jeb drove through the snow.<br />
    “I can drive in it,” he said.<br />
    Wind blew.<br />
    It made big snow piles.<br />
    The snow piles blocked the road.<br />
    “Uh-oh,” said Jeb.<br />
    “We can’t get to the road.”<br />
    “We’re stuck at school!” said Eddy.<br />
    Mr. Grill went into the garage.<br />
    He came out with a snowplow.<br />
    His snowplow pushed the snow.<br />
    Soon the parking lot was clear.<br />
    “We can move now!” said Poppy.<br />
    Mr. Grill pushed the snow piles.<br />
    But the piles were too big.<br />
    Snap!<br />
    “Ugh!” said Mr. Grill.<br />
    “My snowplow broke!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 44: Jeb Helps<br />
    Mr. Grill’s plow was broken.<br />
    “Oh no,” said Eddy.<br />
    “This is bad,” said Mr. Grill.<br />
    The snow got deeper.<br />
    The snow piles got bigger.<br />
    “How will we drive home?” said Poppy.<br />
    Jeb rolled over to Mr. Grill.<br />
    “I can help,” said Jeb.<br />
    Mr. Grill smiled.<br />
    “Yes, Jeb!” he said.<br />
    “You have a scooper!”<br />
    Jeb picked up some snow.<br />
    He moved it away.<br />
    Jeb scooped up more snow.<br />
    Soon the snow piles were gone.<br />
    “Way to go, Jeb!” said Eddy.<br />
    “We can get to the road now!”<br />
    A big snowplow truck drove by.<br />
    He was clearing the road.<br />
    He looked at Jeb and nodded.<br />
    “Good job, kid,” said the truck.<br />
    Jeb grinned.<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 45: Parking<br />
    Everyone was learning how to park.<br />
    “Watch me,” said Ms. Fender.<br />
    The teacher drove backward.<br />
    She turned her wheels.<br />
    She parked next to a curb.<br />
    “Everybody, practice,” said Ms. Fender.<br />
    “We have a test this afternoon.”<br />
    Eddy gulped.<br />
    “I don’t like tests,” he thought.<br />
    Poppy tried to park.<br />
    Her wheel hit the curb.<br />
    “Oops!” she said.<br />
    “I turned too much!”<br />
    She tried again.<br />
    “Oops!” she said.<br />
    “I didn’t turn enough!”<br />
    Eddy backed up.<br />
    He turned.<br />
    He parked next to the curb.<br />
    “Perfect, Eddy,” said Ms. Fender.<br />
    “Wow!” said Jeb.<br />
    “Eddy doesn’t need to practice!”<br />
    Zippy laughed.<br />
    “Parking is slow,” he said.<br />
    “That’s why Eddy can do it!”<br />
    “Grr!” said Eddy.<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 46: A Great Friend<br />
    Poppy tried to park again.<br />
    She backed up.<br />
    She turned.<br />
    Her wheel hit the curb.<br />
    “Ugh!” cried Poppy.<br />
    “I still can’t do this!”<br />
    Zippy laughed.<br />
    Poppy glared at Zippy.<br />
    “Can you park?” she asked.<br />
    “Race cars don’t park,” said Zippy.<br />
    “We go fast!”<br />
    Eddy drove over to Poppy.<br />
    “You just need to practice,” he said.<br />
    “But we have a test,” said Poppy.<br />
    “I’m going to fail it!”<br />
    “No, you won’t,” said Eddy.<br />
    “I’ll help you practice.”<br />
    Poppy smiled.<br />
    “Really?” she asked.<br />
    “Of course,” said Eddy.<br />
    “Story time!” called Ms. Fender.<br />
    Everyone raced over to the teacher.<br />
    “We’ll practice during recess,” said Eddy.<br />
    “Thanks, Eddy!” said Poppy.<br />
    “You’re a great friend!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 47: Recess Race<br />
    It was time for recess.<br />
    Eddy drove onto the parking lot.<br />
    “Hey, slowpoke!” Zippy yelled.<br />
    Zippy took off.<br />
    “Grr!” said Eddy.<br />
    He raced after the bully.<br />
    Poppy was waiting for Eddy.<br />
    But Eddy didn’t see her.<br />
    Eddy chased Zippy around the racetrack.<br />
    They went around and around.<br />
    But Zippy was too fast.<br />
    “Ha-ha!” said Zippy.<br />
    “You’re slow!”<br />
    Zippy shot back to the parking lot.<br />
    Eddy sighed.<br />
    “Zippy is a show-off!” he said.<br />
    Eddy drove back to school.<br />
    He turned into the parking lot.<br />
    “Hi, Poppy,” said Eddy.<br />
    Poppy glared at Eddy.<br />
    “Don’t say hi to me!” she snapped.<br />
    “You forgot to help me!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 48: Poppy Is Mad<br />
    Eddy raced after Poppy.<br />
    “Poppy, wait!” he cried.<br />
    Eddy shot in front of her.<br />
    “Let’s practice now!” he said.<br />
    “No!” said Poppy.<br />
    Poppy backed up fast.<br />
    She tried to go around Eddy.<br />
    Eddy blocked her way.<br />
    Poppy backed up again.<br />
    Poppy turned.<br />
    Then she gasped.<br />
    She was next to the curb.<br />
    “I did it!” cried Poppy.<br />
    “Thanks, Eddy!”<br />
    “You’re welcome,” said Eddy.<br />
    “I’m sorry I didn’t help before.<br />
    Zippy made me so mad.”<br />
    “It’s okay,” said Poppy.<br />
    “Test time!” called Ms. Fender.<br />
    Everyone took the parking test.<br />
    “Yay!” Poppy shouted.<br />
    “I passed the test!”<br />
    Zippy’s wheel hit the curb.<br />
    “Ugh,” he said.<br />
    “I failed!”<br />
    Ms. Fender smiled.<br />
    “Keep practicing, Zippy!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School Episode 49: The Junkyard<br />
    Eddy was with his friends.<br />
    They were driving in the woods.<br />
    “This is fun!” Poppy said.<br />
    The road left the woods.<br />
    The friends stopped.<br />
    They saw piles.<br />
    Old wheels sat in one pile.<br />
    Another pile had car doors.<br />
    Everything was rusty.<br />
    “This is a junkyard,” Jeb said.<br />
    “It’s a place for old parts.”<br />
    “It’s creepy,” Dipper said.<br />
    “It’s not creepy,” Jeb said.<br />
    “Let’s look around.”<br />
    Jeb rolled off.<br />
    Eddy, Poppy, and Dipper followed.<br />
    They went past some big pipes.<br />
    Dipper drove through an oil puddle.<br />
    “Yuck,” she said.<br />
    “Let’s leave,” Dipper said.<br />
    “There might be monsters.”<br />
    “Don’t be silly,” Poppy said.<br />
    “There aren’t monsters,” Eddy said.<br />
    Brumm, brumm!<br />
    Suddenly they heard a loud sound.<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 50: A Monster?<br />
    “I heard a monster!” Dipper cried.<br />
    “Let’s get out of here!”<br />
    “Don’t go!” a voice cried.<br />
    “Who said that?” Eddy asked.<br />
    “Look!” Poppy said.<br />
    “Someone is behind that tire pile.”<br />
    A truck peeked out.<br />
    He had really big tires.<br />
    Dipper gasped.<br />
    “A monster!” she cried.<br />
    “Let’s go!”<br />
    “Wait!” the truck called.<br />
    “I’m a monster truck.<br />
    But I’m very friendly.”<br />
    Dipper gulped.<br />
    “He looks nice,” she whispered.<br />
    “My name is Gasser,” the truck said.<br />
    “It’s nice to meet you, Gasser,” Eddy said.<br />
    “Do you live here?”<br />
    “Yes,” said Gasser.<br />
    “My family just moved here.<br />
    Want to see something cool?”<br />
    Brumm, brumm!<br />
    Gasser sped toward a junk pile.<br />
    “Look out, Gasser!” Eddy cried.<br />
    “You’re going to crash!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 51: Playing Games<br />
    Gasser slammed into the junk pile.<br />
    Smash!<br />
    Brumm, brumm!<br />
    Gasser drove over the pile.<br />
    “Whoa!” Eddy said.<br />
    Crack! Crunch!<br />
    Parts twisted and broke.<br />
    Gasser drove up a bigger pile.<br />
    “Yay!” Dipper cheered.<br />
    “Listen to this,” said Gasser.<br />
    He closed his eyes.<br />
    He took a deep breath.<br />
    Brumm, brumm, brumm!<br />
    Gasser’s engine roared.<br />
    “Wow!” Eddy said.<br />
    “That was super loud!”<br />
    “Let’s play!” Dipper said.<br />
    The friends played hide-and-seek.<br />
    Next they played tag.<br />
    Then they told jokes.<br />
    It was getting late.<br />
    “Good-bye, Gasser,” Eddy said.<br />
    The friends drove home.<br />
    Everyone was sad.<br />
    “Gasser is cool,” Jeb said.<br />
    “Will we ever see him again?”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 52: Really Loud<br />
    “Yesterday was fun,” Poppy said.<br />
    The friends were at school.<br />
    “Yeah,” said Eddy.<br />
    “Gasser is cool.”<br />
    Zippy was driving by.<br />
    He stopped.<br />
    “Who’s Gasser?” he asked.<br />
    “Gasser is our new friend,” Dipper said.<br />
    “He’s a monster truck.”<br />
    Zippy laughed.<br />
    “Monster trucks look silly,” he said.<br />
    “Their tires are too big!”<br />
    Zippy laughed some more.<br />
    A shadow appeared behind him.<br />
    He didn’t see it.<br />
    “Monster trucks are dumb!” Zippy said.<br />
    “They’re not scary at all!”<br />
    The shadow’s engine roared.<br />
    Brumm, brumm, brumm!<br />
    “Ahh!” Zippy screamed.<br />
    He zoomed away.<br />
    The friends gasped.<br />
    “Gasser, it’s you!” cried Poppy.<br />
    “Surprise!” Gasser said.<br />
    “This is my new school!”<br />
    Eddy and his friends cheered.<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 53: The Old Cars’ Home<br />
    “We’re here,” Dipper said.<br />
    “Tire Town Old Cars’ Home.”<br />
    It was Saturday.<br />
    The friends were meeting Dipper’s grandma.<br />
    “This place is nice,” Eddy said.<br />
    “I see a garden,” Poppy said.<br />
    Jeb looked around.<br />
    “Does this place have dirt?” he asked.<br />
    “Nope,” Dipper said.<br />
    “Older cars don’t like dirt.”<br />
    “I don’t see any piles,” said Gasser.<br />
    “There’s nothing to jump over.”<br />
    “Of course not,” Dipper said.<br />
    “Older cars don’t jump over piles.”<br />
    Some cars and trucks drove over.<br />
    “Dipper!” said an ice cream truck.<br />
    “Hi, Grandma!” Dipper said.<br />
    “These are my friends.”<br />
    The older cars smiled at Eddy.<br />
    They smiled at Poppy and Jeb.<br />
    But then the cars saw Gasser.<br />
    “Oh no!” one car said.<br />
    “That truck is scary!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 54: The Dirt Pile<br />
    “Gasser is a monster truck,” Dipper said.<br />
    “But he’s really nice.”<br />
    “I’m Carlin,” said an old van.<br />
    “What do monster trucks do?”<br />
    “I drive on dirt,” Gasser said.<br />
    “I also jump over stuff.”<br />
    “That sounds fun,” Carlin said.<br />
    “It sure does!” Grandma said.<br />
    “Ha-ha, Grandma,” Dipper said.<br />
    “You don’t jump over stuff.”<br />
    “Come on,” Carlin said.<br />
    “We’ll show you kids around.”<br />
    Grandma and Carlin led the way.<br />
    “The garden is so pretty,” Poppy said.<br />
    “Look,” Grandma said.<br />
    “Do you see our new pond?”<br />
    “I see dirt!” Jeb said.<br />
    “That’s a big pile!” Eddy said.<br />
    “Workers left it,” Grandma said.<br />
    “They dug out the pond.<br />
    That’s the dirt from the hole.”<br />
    “The dirt doesn’t look nice,” Carlin said.<br />
    Suddenly—<br />
    crunch!<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 55: Ruining the Garden<br />
    “Oh no!” Gasser said.<br />
    A broken statue lay under him.<br />
    “I’m sorry,” Gasser said.<br />
    “I was looking at the dirt.<br />
    I didn’t see the statue.”<br />
    “That’s okay,” Grandma said.<br />
    “No big deal,” Carlin said.<br />
    “There is more to see!” Grandma said.<br />
    Everyone followed her.<br />
    Smoosh!<br />
    “Uh-oh,” Poppy said.<br />
    “Gasser ran over some flowers!”<br />
    “Please be careful!” Dipper whispered.<br />
    “Sorry,” Gasser said.<br />
    “Don’t worry,” Eddy said.<br />
    “We know you didn’t mean to.”<br />
    “I like this fountain,” Jeb said.<br />
    “It looks like a boat.”<br />
    “This way,” Carlin said.<br />
    Everyone followed.<br />
    Clunk!<br />
    “Ugh!” Gasser cried.<br />
    “My tire knocked over the fountain!”<br />
    He backed into a sign.<br />
    Smash!<br />
    “I’m too big!” Gasser cried.<br />
    “I’m ruining the garden!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 56 : Eddy and Jeb’s Surprise<br />
    Gasser was sad.<br />
    “Don’t be sad,” Poppy said.<br />
    “We can fix everything,” Dipper said.<br />
    “I’ll help,” Carlin said.<br />
    “Jeb, I have an idea,” Eddy said.<br />
    “Follow me.”<br />
    Eddy and Jeb went to the dirt pile.<br />
    Everyone else got to work.<br />
    Dipper planted new flowers.<br />
    Carlin fixed the sign.<br />
    Gasser stood the fountain back up.<br />
    Poppy cleaned up the broken statue.<br />
    Soon the garden looked nice again.<br />
    Gasser smiled.<br />
    Eddy came back.<br />
    “Hey, everyone,” he said.<br />
    “Jeb and I have a surprise!”<br />
    Eddy led everyone to the dirt.<br />
    The pile was gone.<br />
    Now there was a dirt track.<br />
    “That looks fun!” Carlin said.<br />
    “It sure does!” Grandma said.<br />
    Everyone drove on the track.<br />
    Grandma jumped a ramp.<br />
    “Whee!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 57: A Mystery<br />
    Eddy, Jeb, and Gasser were playing.<br />
    “I love dirt,” Jeb said.<br />
    “I love jumping!” Gasser said.<br />
    He drove fast toward a pile.<br />
    Gasser flew through the air.<br />
    Mr. Grill came outside.<br />
    “Good morning, students!” he said.<br />
    “Do we have safety class today?” Zippy asked.<br />
    “That’s so boring.”<br />
    “No,” Mr. Grill said.<br />
    “We’re doing something fun today.”<br />
    “What is it?” Eddy asked.<br />
    “Tell us!” Poppy said.<br />
    Mr. Grill smiled.<br />
    “I’m not telling yet.<br />
    It’s a mystery!”<br />
    “When will you tell us?” Jeb asked.<br />
    “This afternoon,” Mr. Grill said.<br />
    “Meet me in the parking lot.”<br />
    That afternoon the students met.<br />
    They parked in the parking lot.<br />
    “Um,” Dipper said.<br />
    “Where is Mr. Grill?”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 58: Where Is Mr. Grill？<br />
    “Where is Mr. Grill?” Jeb asked.<br />
    “He said to meet here.”<br />
    “Maybe he forgot,” Poppy said.<br />
    “I don’t think so,” Dipper said.<br />
    Everyone looked around.<br />
    But they didn’t see the teacher.<br />
    “Hey!” Gasser said.<br />
    “What’s this?”<br />
    Eddy saw a sheet of paper.<br />
    There was an oval on it.<br />
    “Hmm,” Eddy said.<br />
    “It looks like a racetrack.”<br />
    Poppy gasped.<br />
    “I bet Mr. Grill left it!” she said.<br />
    Everyone looked confused.<br />
    “Why did he leave it?” Zippy asked.<br />
    “So we can find him,” Poppy said.<br />
    “I think it’s a clue.”<br />
    “Oh, fun!” Dipper said.<br />
    “Let’s go to the racetrack!”<br />
    Everyone hurried to the racetrack.<br />
    Eddy saw a sign.<br />
    It said, “Race!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 59: Another Clue<br />
    “Let’s race!” Zippy said.<br />
    He zoomed off.<br />
    Eddy drove fast.<br />
    He zipped around a bend.<br />
    Eddy saw Zippy.<br />
    Zippy was reading another sign.<br />
    Everyone else stopped.<br />
    “What does the sign say?” Gasser asked.<br />
    “It says, ‘Dig!’” Zippy said.<br />
    “Hmm,” Poppy said.<br />
    “Where will we dig?”<br />
    “I know where to dig,” Jeb said.<br />
    “At the construction site!”<br />
    Everyone went to the construction site.<br />
    Jeb dug.<br />
    He dug deep.<br />
    He dug up a box.<br />
    Poppy opened the box.<br />
    “It’s a horn,” she said.<br />
    “Another clue,” Eddy said.<br />
    “Honk the horn, Poppy.”<br />
    Honk!<br />
    Poppy honked the horn.<br />
    Nothing happened.<br />
    Eddy sighed.<br />
    “Now what do we do?”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 60: Honk, Honk!<br />
    “Look!” Dipper said.<br />
    “There’s a picture in the box.”<br />
    The picture showed a road.<br />
    An<br />
    X<br />
    was next to it.<br />
    “Oh!” Eddy said.<br />
    “We’re going to drive off-road.”<br />
    “How do you know?” Jeb said.<br />
    “See the<br />
    X<br />
    ?” Eddy said.<br />
    “It is<br />
    off<br />
    the road.”<br />
    “You’re smart, Eddy,” Poppy said.<br />
    “So where do we go?” Gasser asked.<br />
    “Where can we drive off-road?”<br />
    “In the woods,” Eddy said.<br />
    “Follow me!”<br />
    Everyone drove along the trail.<br />
    They came to a stop sign.<br />
    Eddy looked around.<br />
    He didn’t see any clues.<br />
    Honk!<br />
    Poppy honked the horn.<br />
    Suddenly—<br />
    Honk, honk!<br />
    Someone honked back!<br />
    “It’s Mr. Grill!” Dipper cried.<br />
    “Good job, everyone,” Mr. Grill said.<br />
    “You found me!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 61: Amazing News<br />
    Eddy and his friends were playing.<br />
    Jeb chased Poppy.<br />
    Zippy zoomed by.<br />
    “You’re all slow!” he said.<br />
    Ms. Fender came outside.<br />
    “Come here, everyone!” she called.<br />
    “I have some news!”<br />
    Everyone hurried over.<br />
    “What is it?” Dipper asked.<br />
    “Field trip tomorrow!” Ms. Fender said.<br />
    “Someone will do something amazing!”<br />
    “I’ll bet it’s a race,” Zippy said.<br />
    “Someone will go fast!”<br />
    Zippy zoomed around the parking lot.<br />
    “No, Zippy,” Ms. Fender said.<br />
    “We’re not going to a race.”<br />
    “Will someone build something?” Jeb asked.<br />
    “Nope,” Ms. Fender said.<br />
    “Will a car do jumps?” Gasser asked.<br />
    “Nope,” Ms. Fender said.<br />
    “What is it then?” Eddy asked.<br />
    “Tell us!” Poppy cried.<br />
    Ms. Fender grinned.<br />
    “Someone will say good-bye!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 62: The Spaceport<br />
    Everyone drove along the road.<br />
    “Hmm,” Eddy thought.<br />
    “Who’s going to say good-bye?”<br />
    “We’re here,” Ms. Fender said.<br />
    “The Tire Town Spaceport.<br />
    Please follow the rules.”<br />
    Everyone gasped.<br />
    “I see a rocket!” Jeb said.<br />
    “His name is Rocky,” Ms. Fender said.<br />
    “He’s going to space.<br />
    We’ll watch him blast off!”<br />
    “Whoa,” Dipper said.<br />
    “Space is so cool,” Poppy said.<br />
    Gasser stared at Rocky.<br />
    His eyes were big.<br />
    “I never saw a rocket before!”<br />
    “Me neither,” Eddy said.<br />
    “Rockets are so fast!”<br />
    “Ms. Fender!” Gasser called.<br />
    “Can we meet Rocky?”<br />
    “Yes,” Ms. Fender said.<br />
    “We’re going to meet him now.”<br />
    “Cool,” Eddy said.<br />
    “I can’t wait to meet Rocky.”<br />
    Zippy laughed.<br />
    “You’re slow!” he said.<br />
    “Rocky won’t want to meet you!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 63: Rocky<br />
    “Zippy is mean,” Eddy thought.<br />
    He drove away from Zippy.<br />
    Eddy watched the busy spaceport.<br />
    A fuel truck drove by.<br />
    “I’m bringing fuel to Rocky!”<br />
    “Let’s meet Rocky,” Ms. Fender said.<br />
    They drove over to the rocket.<br />
    Eddy blinked.<br />
    Rocky was huge!<br />
    “Hi, kids!” Rocky said.<br />
    “Will you watch me blast off?”<br />
    “Yes!” everyone yelled.<br />
    “My job is important,” Rocky said.<br />
    “I’m bringing things to space.”<br />
    “How will you do that?” Jeb asked.<br />
    “My engine is strong,” Rocky said.<br />
    “I can fly very fast.”<br />
    “I’m fast too,” Zippy said.<br />
    “Watch this!”<br />
    Zippy sped off.<br />
    Zoom!<br />
    He shot across the spaceport.<br />
    “Uh-oh,” Eddy said.<br />
    “Zippy is breaking the rules.”<br />
    Ms. Fender beeped her horn.<br />
    “No speeding, Zippy!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 64: Blastoff!<br />
    Zippy zoomed around the spaceport.<br />
    Trucks jumped out of the way.<br />
    Zippy laughed.<br />
    Then he gasped.<br />
    Zippy was speeding toward a truck.<br />
    The truck was carrying a satellite.<br />
    Zippy slammed his brakes and slid.<br />
    Bam!<br />
    Zippy crashed into the truck.<br />
    “My wheel is broken!” the truck said.<br />
    “I can’t bring Rocky this satellite.”<br />
    “Jeb and I can help!” Eddy said.<br />
    Eddy and Jeb hurried over.<br />
    Jeb picked up the satellite.<br />
    He put it in Eddy’s dumper.<br />
    Eddy drove it to Rocky.<br />
    Ms. Fender went to Zippy.<br />
    “You’re in big trouble,” she said.<br />
    “Get ready!” a voice said.<br />
    “Blastoff is in ten seconds!”<br />
    Everyone counted down.<br />
    “Good-bye!” Rocky said.<br />
    Rumble!<br />
    Rumble!<br />
    Rocky blasted off.<br />
    Eddy waved. “Bye, Rocky!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 65: Tire Town Beach<br />
    “I love the beach!” Dipper said.<br />
    “Me too,” Eddy said.<br />
    “The sun feels warm.”<br />
    “This is boring,” Zippy said.<br />
    “I can’t go fast on sand!”<br />
    The cars were on a field trip.<br />
    They were at Tire Town Beach.<br />
    “The water looks fun,” said Dipper.<br />
    Ms. Fender frowned.<br />
    “Don’t forget.<br />
    Cars cannot go in the water.”<br />
    Jeb dug sand.<br />
    He loaded it in Eddy’s dumper.<br />
    A boat floated on the sea.<br />
    “Wow,” Dipper said.<br />
    “I wish we could float.”<br />
    Poppy nodded.<br />
    “The water looks fun,” she said.<br />
    “It sure does!” Gasser said.<br />
    Gasser looked around.<br />
    “I don’t see Ms. Fender,” he said.<br />
    Brumm, brumm!<br />
    Gasser went fast.<br />
    Gasser zoomed through the water.<br />
    It splashed everyone!<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 66: Gasser’s Big Splash<br />
    Water splashed.<br />
    “Yay!” Dipper cheered.<br />
    Gasser drove through the water again.<br />
    Splash!<br />
    “Do it again, Gasser!” Poppy said.<br />
    Just then Ms. Fender drove over.<br />
    “Gasser,” she said.<br />
    “Stop that right now!”<br />
    Gasser frowned.<br />
    “Sorry,” he said.<br />
    “Just play in the sand,” Ms. Fender said.<br />
    “Water is not for cars!”<br />
    Ms. Fender drove off.<br />
    Gasser waited for a moment.<br />
    “Ms. Fender is gone,” he said.<br />
    Brumm, brumm!<br />
    Gasser sped through the water again.<br />
    Everyone laughed.<br />
    “The water feels great,” Dipper said.<br />
    “I’m going in!”<br />
    “No, Dipper!” Eddy said.<br />
    “It’s fine,” Dipper said.<br />
    Dipper drove into the water.<br />
    She went in deeper and deeper.<br />
    Dipper called to her friends.<br />
    “Come on in!” she said.<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 67: Splashing and Playing<br />
    “The water feels nice!” Dipper said.<br />
    “You should come out,” Jeb said.<br />
    “Yeah,” Eddy said.<br />
    “Ms. Fender will be mad.”<br />
    But Dipper didn’t listen.<br />
    She went in even deeper.<br />
    Poppy went closer to the water.<br />
    The others followed.<br />
    Brumm, brumm!<br />
    Gasser splashed into the water.<br />
    Everyone laughed.<br />
    Jeb scooped some water.<br />
    Eddy dipped his tire.<br />
    “I’m going in,” Zippy said.<br />
    He drove into the waves.<br />
    “Me too!” Jeb said.<br />
    He splashed into the water.<br />
    Poppy went in next.<br />
    “Come on, Eddy!” she said.<br />
    Eddy went in.<br />
    “This is fun!” he said.<br />
    Everyone splashed and played.<br />
    Pop!<br />
    “Uh-oh!” Eddy said.<br />
    “My engine stopped!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 68: Toots<br />
    “This is bad!” Eddy said.<br />
    “I can’t drive!”<br />
    “Me neither!” Dipper cried.<br />
    “What will we do?”<br />
    Ms. Fender came over.<br />
    She gasped. “Water is not for cars!”<br />
    “We’re sorry!” Dipper said.<br />
    “Now we’re stuck!”<br />
    Ms. Fender sighed.<br />
    “I’ll get help,” she said.<br />
    A small boat arrived.<br />
    “I’m Toots,” she said.<br />
    Toots pushed everyone onto the sand.<br />
    “Stay on land,” Toots said.<br />
    “Water is not for cars.”<br />
    The cars still couldn’t drive.<br />
    “Your engines are wet,” Ms. Fender said.<br />
    “The sun will dry them.”<br />
    Soon Eddy’s engine was dry.<br />
    The others could drive too.<br />
    Everyone drove back to school.<br />
    “What did you learn today?” Ms. Fender asked.<br />
    “Water is fun,” Dipper said.<br />
    “But it is not for cars!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 69: A Talent<br />
    “Did you hear?” Dipper asked.<br />
    “Hear what?” Eddy asked.<br />
    “We’re having a talent show!” Dipper said.<br />
    “I will play music in it!”<br />
    Dipper played her music.<br />
    She spun around and sang.<br />
    “What will you do, Jeb?” Eddy asked.<br />
    “Watch this!” Jeb said.<br />
    Jeb rolled to the dirt area.<br />
    He lifted a big rock.<br />
    “Wow!” everyone said.<br />
    “I will lift big things,” Jeb said.<br />
    “I can tell jokes,” Poppy said.<br />
    “And I can do balloon tricks!”<br />
    Poppy’s trunk popped open.<br />
    Balloons floated out.<br />
    “Cool!” Gasser said.<br />
    “I will drive over things.”<br />
    Brumm, brumm!<br />
    Gasser drove over a dirt pile.<br />
    “What will you do, Eddy?” Jeb asked.<br />
    Eddy frowned. “I don’t know.”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 70: Dipper’s Music Player<br />
    “This stinks,” Eddy said.<br />
    “I don’t have a talent!”<br />
    “Don’t be silly,” Poppy said.<br />
    “Think, Eddy,” Dipper said.<br />
    “What do you love to do?”<br />
    “I like to go fast,” Eddy said.<br />
    Just then Zippy drove over.<br />
    Zippy laughed. “You’re slow.”<br />
    “Going fast is not your talent!”<br />
    Zippy sped off.<br />
    “Grr!” Eddy zoomed after Zippy.<br />
    They raced around the parking lot.<br />
    Then they zoomed back.<br />
    Eddy skidded.<br />
    “Oh no!” Dipper cried.<br />
    Crash!<br />
    Eddy banged into Dipper.<br />
    “Oof!” Dipper cried.<br />
    “Sorry!” Eddy said.<br />
    “Are you okay?”<br />
    “I think so,” Dipper said.<br />
    She tried to play her music.<br />
    But no sound came out.<br />
    Dipper gulped.<br />
    “My music player broke!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 71: A New Music Player<br />
    “This stinks!” Dipper said.<br />
    “We’re having a talent show.<br />
    I need my music player!”<br />
    “Let’s check my junkyard,” Gasser said.<br />
    “Maybe we can find one there.”<br />
    The friends searched the junkyard.<br />
    Gasser found a music player.<br />
    “Thank you!” Dipper said.<br />
    “I’ll put it in later.<br />
    Eddy, can you carry it?”<br />
    Eddy nodded.<br />
    Jeb lifted the music player.<br />
    He put it in Eddy’s dumper.<br />
    Suddenly Jeb bumped a tire pile.<br />
    One tire bounced onto Poppy.<br />
    “Ouch!” Poppy said.<br />
    Her hood got dented.<br />
    “Sorry!” Jeb said.<br />
    Gasser found Poppy a new hood.<br />
    Jeb lifted the hood.<br />
    He placed it in Eddy’s dumper.<br />
    Jeb looked at the hood.<br />
    It balanced on the music player.<br />
    Jeb told Eddy.<br />
    Eddy grinned.<br />
    “I have an idea, Jeb!” he said.<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 72: The Talent Show<br />
    “Good morning,” Ms. Fender said.<br />
    “It’s time for the talent show!”<br />
    Dipper spun around in circles.<br />
    Her music filled the air.<br />
    Zippy zoomed across the parking lot.<br />
    “Watch me!” he said.<br />
    Gasser drove over dirt piles.<br />
    Poppy told jokes.<br />
    She did balloon tricks.<br />
    Jeb looked at Eddy.<br />
    “It’s our turn now,” Jeb said.<br />
    Jeb lifted a big rock.<br />
    He tossed it through the air.<br />
    Everyone gasped.<br />
    Eddy spun around and—<br />
    Bang!<br />
    The rock landed in Eddy’s dumper.<br />
    “Got it!” Eddy said.<br />
    “Yay!” everyone cheered.<br />
    Jeb tossed another rock.<br />
    Eddy moved fast.<br />
    Crunch!<br />
    He caught the rock.<br />
    The rock landed on the first rock!<br />
    Jeb threw more rocks.<br />
    Soon Eddy balanced six rocks.<br />
    Everyone cheered.<br />
    Eddy and Jeb grinned.<br />
