	It rained. It rained all day. It rained all night. It rained and
rained and would not stop. It rained for three days. The
water was everywhere.
Close to the city, there was a fish pond. It was full of fish.
The rain filled the pond with water. The water rose higher
and higher. Then, the walls of the fish pond broke.
The water rushed out of the pond. The fish rushed out of
the pond too. They spilled into the streets nearby. There
was almost half a metre of water in the streets.
“Look! There are fish in the street!” a young girl exclaimed.
“I can see them swimming right here in our street!”
Kids from the neighbourhood got their fishing poles. They
put on their raincoats and their boots. They went out and
started to fish.
“Hey!” shouted a boy. “I have a fish! I caught a fish!” The
fish were everywhere. Some kids caught fish. Others had
fun trying to catch one. Parents came out to help them
too. The street became busy and noisy. It was filled with
laughter. Everyone was having a good time.
It stopped raining after a while. The owner of the fish pond
fixed the hole. People heard on the radio where the fish
had come from. They helped the owner collect the fish and
put them back into the pond.
The street was just a normal street again.
But the children said, “We will never forget this day. The
day we fished in the street! It was the best day ever!”

Did It Hurt?
Moms are moms. And when you are growing up, you don’t
always know how much they do for you. They’re just
moms. But they do some pretty cool things too. They do
things that you remember all your life.
My mom was like that. When I was six years old, one of
my front teeth was very loose. When I touched it, I could
wiggle it back and forth. I was scared. I didn’t know what
was going on. So I asked Mom to look at it.
Mom said that I was going to lose all of my teeth. “In the
next few years, all of your teeth will fall out.”
“My teeth are going to fall out?” I cried. “How will I chew
my food?”
Mom laughed. “Don’t worry,” she said. “Each of us gets
two sets of teeth. Your baby teeth are not designed to last
a long time. They are there just to make a place for your
permanent teeth to come in.”
Still, I was worried. “It will hurt so much,” I said. I imagined
how it would feel to have a tooth fall out, and it scared me
just a little.
Mom said that she could help me. She asked me to sit in a
chair and close my eyes.
Mom reached into my mouth and took hold of the loose
tooth. “Keep your eyes shut,” she said. “Think about
something funny. I will just check this tooth.”
Then, Mom said, “Open your eyes.” Do you know what?
She was holding the tooth in her hand.
I could not believe it. While she was talking, she pulled the
tooth out and I did not feel a thing!
That’s just the way it is with moms. They know what to do.
And they have a way of doing it that makes it painless.

Tooth Fairy
All over the world, many young children believe in magic.
It’s just the way a child’s mind works. As we get older,
many of us lose our ability to believe in magic. But while
we are young, anything is possible.
In Canada, young children believe in a magical character
known as the “Tooth Fairy”. The Tooth Fairy is a small
creature with wings, and very pretty. Can you guess what
she does? She is responsible for taking care of children’s
baby teeth.
Children get two sets of teeth. One set is called the baby
teeth. Baby teeth fall out on their own as children reach
the age of seven. When a baby tooth falls out, or is pulled
out, children do not throw it away.
Instead, they hide this tooth under their pillow when they
go to bed. They are very excited. They think about the
Tooth Fairy as they fall asleep. They truly believe that the
Tooth Fairy will visit them. And best of all, they believe that
she will do something special when she arrives.
During the night, the Tooth Fairy comes and takes the
tooth. But the special thing is that she leaves something
behind for the children.
She leaves money in place of the tooth. When the children
wake up the next morning, the first thing they do is to look
under their pillow. The tooth is gone, but there is a small
amount of money in its place.
Losing your baby teeth is scary. But the Tooth Fairy makes
it a lot easier. After all, she makes a trade. And in a few
weeks, a new tooth will start to grow in your mouth.

Picture on My Desk
There is a picture sitting on the desk in my room. It’s a
picture of my parents smiling together in a peach garden.
It is special to me because it’s the first picture I took for
them when I was four years old.
It was a holiday weekend. My parents took me to visit a
peach orchard in the suburbs. The peach trees were just
beginning to bloom. It was a sea of peach flowers -- pink
and white. So beautiful! There was a wonderful sweet
smell in the air too. My parents started taking pictures.
They took a picture of me, pictures of me and my father,
and of me and my mother.
Then Mom asked, “Do you want to take a picture of us
too?”
“Yes, yes!” I said cheerfully. But Dad was worried. He said
I was too young and I might drop the camera. He did not
want me to break it.
Mom said, “Let him try. He will be careful. He will not drop
the camera.” Dad was not sure, but he agreed.
Mom and Dad smiled at the camera. Mom told me to look
through the little hole where I would see them both in the
middle.
“Then hold your breath and click,” she said. I listened to
Mom’s instructions. Holding the camera tightly, I looked
through the hole. Yes, I saw them. I saw them in the
middle of the window. I pressed the button. Click! The
picture was taken!
We got the picture back a few days later. It looked great!
Mom and Dad were both in the picture, smiling.
That picture is my favourite. That’s why I have it sitting in a
special place on my desk. It reminds me of my happy
childhood and my first adventure with a camera.

Snowed Under
Everywhere in the world, kids go to school. There are
schools in cities and schools in rural areas. In Africa,
schools are sometimes built with grass and sticks. In other
places, classes are held outdoors without any building at
all.
When I was a young teacher, my first teaching job was in
a village in the far north of Canada. There were no roads.
You had to take an airplane to fly into the village. I was
quite nervous about this new job. But I packed my bags
and headed north for my adventure.
In the autumn, when I arrived, the weather was fine. The
sun shone and the days were clear. But all of that was
soon to change. In late October, the season changed
abruptly. One morning, I awoke and it was winter. There
was no warning at all. That’s just the way it is in the
Canadian Arctic region.
In winter, it is very cold in Canada’s north. It snows a lot,
too. One winter day, it started to snow really, really hard.
The wind blew. And the snow did not stop. It snowed for a
whole day. It snowed all night, too.
On the morning of the third day, the snow finally stopped
coming down. I woke up and peeked out my window. The
students looked out their windows too. They could not see
their school.
“Our school has disappeared,” they cried. All they could
see was white snow piled up everywhere. The snow
covered the school completely. It was piled more than 8
metres high. It was amazing! But not everyone was
surprised. “It happens every year,” said the school
principal. “This is Canada. This is how we get to school in
the far north.”
Of course, there was no school that day. The people in the
village came and helped the janitor dig out the snow. It
took three days to uncover the school!
The kids enjoyed their days off. But they were glad to get
back to school finally.

A Blind Man
Every day when Mike and Sally play outside, they see a
man walking. He walks with a white stick. He cannot see.
He is blind. It always puzzles them. “How can he walk on a
busy street?” asks Mike. “It must be very dangerous,” says
Sally.
The boy and girl watch as the man walks. He walks slowly.
He walks to the traffic light and then stops. When the light
turns green, he starts walking again. He does not hit
anything as he walks. “It’s amazing. And it must be scary
too,” says Sally. “He knows where to go and where to stop
as if he could see.”
One day, as the blind man was passing by, he heard the
children talking. He stopped in front of their house. “Hello
kids,” he said, “I hear you talking about how I walk.”
“Yes, we always wonder how you know where to go and
when to stop on such a busy street. It is safer to stay
indoors.”
The man smiled, “I trained myself to listen very well. I
listen with my ears for every sound when I am out of the
house. I use my stick to help me too. When my stick
bumps into something, I know to stop and go around it.”
The man continued, “Yes, it is safer to stay indoors. But I
love to walk. I love the hot sun. I love the smell of flowers.
I love to hear the birds singing. Most of all, I love to get
some exercise.”
Sally said, “Thank you. We have learned something today.
We think you are a brave man. We can see. We can walk.
We will get some exercise, too. You are a good example
for us to follow.”

My First Day as a Teacher
Ms. Wood, our Grade 3 teacher, is a really good teacher.
She cares about her students. That’s why she was named
“Teacher of the Year” for our school district.
Today, Ms. Wood told us a funny story about her first day
as a teacher. She said, “On my first day as a teacher, I
was nervous. I was scared. I told myself I will never be
able to do this!”
“The morning I was to begin teaching, I arrived really early.
My hands were shaking. My throat was dry. My stomach
was filled with butterflies. I looked at the clock. The
students would arrive in five minutes. I felt a wave of panic
inside.
“I was so frightened. I hid myself behind the desk. The
students came in and looked for their teacher. I heard
them whispering, ‘Where is she? Where is our new
teacher, Ms. Wood?’
“Finally, I stood up from behind the desk. Everyone was
surprised. I decided to be honest with my students. I took
a deep breath, and told the kids how frightened I was. But
I also told them that I wanted to be their best friend and
best teacher, too.
“They did not laugh at me. They understood my fear. One
boy said, ‘That’s okay, Ms. Wood. I get frightened too.’
The students were all standing there, smiling at me. They
made me feel so comfortable. My fear slowly disappeared.
“I can make a joke about it now. But on my first day as a
teacher, I was ready to run away. I am very glad that I
stayed and overcame my fear.
“I am ‘Teacher of the Year’ now. But on my first day as a
teacher, my fear almost got the best of me.”

Noodles for Mom
My mom works hard. She takes care of me and my young
sister. Every day when she gets home from work, she
makes supper for us.
One day, I decided to help my mom. She’s always taking
care of us and feeding us, so I figured, “It’s about time I do
something for her too. I’m nine years old.”
I decided to cook supper for her. I don’t know a lot about
cooking. But it doesn’t look that difficult, right? Noodles are
easy to cook. All you do is to boil water in a pot, then add
the noodles and continue boiling. This was how I saw my
mom doing it many times.
I was really excited. “Today, when Mom comes home,
supper will be cooked. We will sit down and eat some
tasty noodles,” I said to myself.
After school I ran home eagerly and started cooking. I
boiled the water on the stove and added the noodles. I
was very careful. I cooked the noodles a long time.
It can’t hurt, right?
Just before Mom got home, I turned off the stove. The
noodles were not like the kind my mom usually makes.
They were very mushy. They were more like a soup.
Mom was surprised when she came home. She put the
noodles in bowls and sat with me and ate her noodles.
“Mmm! These are very good noodles,” she said. “These
are the best noodles in the world. You make a very good
noodle soup, my son.”
I knew that I had overcooked the noodles. They were
terrible. But that’s not the point. Mom knew that I was
trying to help out. Later, she told me that she would give
me a cooking lesson if I wanted.

The Monkeys and the Fish
(adapted from a traditional African tale)
It began to rain in the rich and fertile valley. The rain
pounding down and did not stop for more than fifteen
days. The rivers and the lakes were swollen. And all the
animals headed to the mountains, seeking safety.
The monkeys were not as worried as the other animals,
for they had good brains and could easily make their way
uphill to safety if they needed to.
For now, they were perched high in the trees overlooking
the flooded lands.
One monkey noticed fish swimming in the water --
swimming and leaping and having a great time. Fish, you
know, love water and they welcomed the floods with
pleasure. In fact, it made them quite happy, and that was
why they were leaping out of the water.
The monkey said to his friends, “Look there. What are
those strange creatures doing? Can you see them in the
water? They appear to be in danger.”
His friends looked too, and they all agreed with him.
“Perhaps we should go and save them,” offered one
monkey. “After all, we are the smartest in the jungle.”
Everyone agreed. So the monkeys approached the edge
of the flood waters and began to catch the fish and bring
them safely to land.
The fish were difficult to catch. One monkey even
commented that it seemed a shame that these animals
without legs did not appreciate what the good monkeys
were doing for them.
Soon enough, all the fish were caught and piled on the
land. They lay there motionless. “Not a move from them at
all,” observed a monkey.
“See, we were right to save them,” said a wise monkey.
“They were tired, and now they are resting. Surely, they
will soon wake up and thank us for our efforts.”
And with that, the monkeys headed to the hills to see what
else they could do.

Dinosaur Dung
My grandfather came to visit us from Japan. He was only
staying with us for one month. So I planned many things
to show him around. Where did I start? The Museum of
Nature! Why? It’s right in our neighbourhood.
On the first Saturday morning after his arrival, we went to
the museum. It’s free admission on weekends. Many
families with young kids were there visiting.
Right after we entered the building, a giant life-sized
dinosaur model came into our sight. We went directly to
the dinosaur gallery.
A fossil display attracted many visitors.
A scientist was talking to kids, holding a big piece of fossil
in her hand. In front of her, there were many fossils
displayed on the desk. The scientist was asking the young
kids questions as they looked curiously at the fossils.
“Can you guess what this fossil is?” she asked.
“That’s a dinosaur tooth,” answered one kid confidently
because he saw some teeth in the stone.
The scientist nodded, “That’s right.” She grabbed another
pebble-sized fossil from a small box in which there were
many small, round, stone-like fossils.
“Can you tell me which part of the dinosaur this is from?”
she asked another kid.
The kids looked and looked, but they had no clue what it
could be.
“A finger?”
“No.”
“Toes?”
“No.”
“A tail?”
“No, no!”
Finally the children begged, “Could you please tell us what
it is?” The scientist smiled, “It’s dino dung -- a fossilized
dinosaur dropping.”
At first, the kids were surprised. Then, they all laughed.
My grandfather took the fossil and looked at it carefully. He
passed it to me. How unbelievable! We not only saw the
fossils of dinosaur toes and teeth, but also of dinosaur
dung. We were both amazed that we could touch fossils
from giant creatures that lived on the earth 65 million
years ago.

When an Apple Falls
Imagine yourself under the cool shade of an apple tree.
Your mind and body relax as you sit quietly, thinking.
Suddenly, a ripe apple falls from the tree, narrowly missing
your head.
Most of us would be thankful that the apple did not hit us.
And that would be the end of it. But sometimes, an
ordinary happening can lead to extraordinary results.
Such was the case in the 17th century. Isaac Newton
spent his life working out many laws of physics. He
wanted to figure out how things worked. For him, the world
was his laboratory in those early days of science.
For a long time, he had been working on the “laws of
motion”. One lucky day, as he was sitting in his study at
his mother’s country home, he looked out over the yard.
The apple trees were filled with ripe, red apples.
As he sat there thinking, he noticed an apple falling from
the tree. Apples fall from trees all the time. They even fall
and hit people on the head. But Isaac Newton’s falling
apple was no ordinary apple. And Newton was no ordinary
man.
He saw more than an apple falling from a tree. As he
watched the apple hit the ground, he asked himself some
simple questions: Why did that apple fall straight down?
Why did it not fall sideways? Why did it not fall up, towards
the sky, instead of down, towards the centre of the earth?
With these simple questions, Newton discovered gravity.
More correctly, he discovered how gravity works.
Scientists could now understand why the moon was held
in orbit around the earth. Gravity explained why people did
not fall off the face of the earth.
Imagine if Newton had watched that apple falling, and
thought nothing more than, “Oh yes, just another apple
falling from a tree!”

Surprises for Everyone!
My grandma moved to a new townhouse. Her house is
connected to the houses right beside hers. The
townhouses are all brand new and look the same. My
brother and I wanted to make something special as a gift
for her new house. We thought we would surprise her and
build a wooden deck in her little backyard.
One day, when my grandma was away with her neighbour
Jenny, we came over with some wood, nails, a saw and
two hammers. We took out our tools and started the
construction project immediately.
It was hard work. We worked all day and even into the
evening. When we were finished, we took a deep breath
and went home, satisfied. We called her the next morning
and said, “Don’t go out into your backyard. We have
something special for you.”
Fifteen minutes later when we came over and opened the
back door, to our surprise, our deck was gone! Someone
had stolen it. Just then, Gramma’s neighbour Jenny came
out and said, “Hey, look! Someone built a deck in my
backyard!”
“Oh no!” we cried. The houses looked so much alike that
we had gotten mixed up!
Grandma laughed until she cried. And we all laughed. We
left the deck at Jenny’s and built a new one for our
grandma. Then we had a deck party. It was a lot of work,
but a lot of fun too.

No Snakes in Ireland
(adapted from an Irish tale)
Long long ago, there lived a young boy, named Patrick.
One day, he was captured by evil men, taken into slavery,
and brought to the green and beautiful island called
Ireland.
His masters set him to work tending sheep in the hills of
that country. Patrick spent his days looking after the sheep
and dreaming of his escape. One night, as he lay asleep
under the starry sky, a spirit came to him in a dream.
“You will be free,” the spirit told him. “Rise and move south
towards the sea. There you will find a ship waiting to take
you to freedom.”
The boy was frightened, but he did as he was told.
He walked southward, following the stars and the moon
that showed the way. As promised, a ship was waiting for
the lad. It sailed to France, where Patrick was a free man.
But he could not forget about Ireland. He desperately
wanted to return to that fair country which he had come to
love. Patrick grew into a man, and following his heart, he
set sail again for Ireland. The Irish welcomed him, for he
was brave, wise and capable of teaching them. He
travelled all over the island and was respected by all.
In that time, there were many snakes in Ireland, and most
people were frightened of them. Patrick decided to do
something about this. He began to capture the snakes and
put them in a huge wooden box.
When he had collected the last snake in Ireland, he closed
the lid tightly and began to walk towards the sea. On
arriving at the coastline, Patrick threw the box with the
snakes into the wild, raging ocean.
The sea grew angry. The wind blew and the waves rose
high into the sky. The captured snakes were struggling in
the box to get free, but they could not escape.
That is why there are no snakes in Ireland today. And it is
said that when the sea rises and roars and the waves
crash against the shore, it is the snakes of Patrick fighting
against the box to be free.

Flightless Bird
We share our world with many strange and amazing
animals. Look up in the sky and you’ll see birds flying
gracefully, for example.
What is a bird? It’s an animal with wings, of course.
And what do birds do with their wings? They fly. Simple
enough, right? But wait a minute... there are birds that
don’t fly. Are they still birds?
Yes, they are. All birds have wings, but not all birds can fly.
It’s strange, but true. Millions of black and white birds live
in Antarctica, and they don’t fly. In fact, they spend a lot of
time in the ocean, using their wings to swim. They’re
called penguins, and they’re really fun to watch.
It’s cold in Antarctica. Really cold! In winter, the sun does
not rise. It’s dark all the time, yet penguins manage to
have a pretty good life there. How do they stay warm?
They have a thick layer of fat that is covered with cold-
proof feathers called “down”. On top of the down, there is
another layer of feathers that keeps the cold water from
reaching the penguins’ skin.
The adult male penguin finds a female penguin, and they
raise a family. The Emperor penguin has a unique way of
starting a family. The female lays one egg on the foot of
the male. She then leaves and goes to the ocean, where
she spends many weeks eating and playing.
Meanwhile, the male stands alone on shore, keeping the
egg covered with his warm body. He does not eat. He
does not move. He stands there, waiting for the egg to
hatch. Strange, right? During this time, he must be very
hungry, yet he doesn’t leave the egg.
The female comes back just before it’s time for the baby
penguin to be born. She allows the male to go and eat
then. He weighs only half as much as he did when he
started.
Why do they do this? No one knows. It’s a strange and
wonderful way of the animal kingdom. Observe nature
closely. You will be amazed at what you can learn.

The Boy Named Liam
Friends of my parents went to Africa to help in a very poor
part of a very poor country. They were there to help bring
medical supplies and teach the people.
One day, they were walking in a field near a town that had
been burned to the ground during the war. They saw
something moving in the long grass and thought it was a
wounded animal.
As they got closer, they saw it was a baby boy. He was
only about a year old. He was burned a little, but not too
badly. He was crying and sick. The friends of my parents
asked their guide, “What can we do? Can we find his
family?”
The man looked around and said, “The family must have
been destroyed by this war.” “How hard would it be to
adopt this little baby?” asked the friends of my parents.
The man said, “Take him. He’s yours. There is no one
here to look after him.”
They took the little boy back to my country and adopted
him. They gave him the name Liam.
Liam did not grow as big as the other kids. But he was a
very good athlete. He was on our school basketball team.
And he also played good volleyball and soccer. He was a
special part of our school. We all liked him.
Whenever there was a need in the school, he was always
the first one to help out.
One day, the school decided to sponsor a child living in a
poor country in South America. We needed to raise money
and send it every month. Liam spent countless hours
setting up the whole thing. In fact, he was the best
fundraiser in the whole school. No one could turn down
Liam.
In the end, we raised so much money that we were able to
sponsor three children in poor countries. It says a lot
about our school’s spirit. But most of all, it says a lot about
Liam.
The little African boy worked tirelessly because others had
worked hard to give him a chance in life.

A Children’s World Game
Kids are kids, no matter where they live. On fine spring
days, you find them outside looking for games to play. It’s
the nature of being young.
Take the game of marbles for example. From villages in
deepest Africa to towns along the China Sea, youngsters
have been playing a version of this traditional game for
thousands of years.
There are many reasons why the game of marbles has
been so popular. It’s easy to play and requires no
equipment. Both the rich and the poor have an equal
chance of winning. If you have at least one marble, you
can get into a game. And if you’re skilful, you can win.
Perhaps most important of all, the rules are flexible. That
means that the rules can be changed by the players.
That’s why there are no written rules for marbles. You and
your friends can get a game going and, as long as you all
agree, those are the rules for the game in your
neighbourhood.
However, the goal is always the same. Players put their
marbles on the ground. They try to win their opponents’
marbles by hitting the marbles or by knocking them out of
a circle. At the end of a game, one player goes home with
a bag full of marbles. The others go home with bags that
are far lighter than when they arrived.
The actual marbles have changed a lot since the early
days when Egyptian children and later, the Romans,
played the game.
The first marbles were small round stones. Later, clay
marbles appeared. Even later, marbles started being
made from glass. The prettiest glass marbles are always
the most valuable. Marble players often trade marbles,
trying to get the most colourful and beautiful ones for
themselves.
Today, there is an International Marble Championship. But
as any youngster knows, the best game of marbles is
played in the schoolyard. The days are warm, the marbles
roll easily, and friends gather around to see who will have
the best luck that day.

Father’s Dream
Life would be rather dull if we did not have dreams.
Dreams are things we hope to accomplish in the future.
Do you have any dreams?
One of my dad’s biggest dreams is to sail around the
world on a sailing ship. He and his best friend always talk
about it.
So this summer, they decided to rent a small boat and
take us all for a one-week vacation. That way, they could
test out their skills. They could learn on a small lake where
it is safe.
We rented a nice houseboat and began our adventure on
a nice sunny day. Everything went well the first day. The
water was calm. There was no wind and everyone was
happy. It felt like their dream was coming true.
But the next day, when we sailed to the river that
connected to the lake, a strong wind came up. It made the
waves really big. The boat started to bounce around. It
was a little scary. The mothers held their kids tightly. No
one was laughing or even talking.
The river got wider and wider. The waves were even
stronger. The wind was blowing our boat far from land. My
dad had trouble controlling the boat. He decided that we
should go back.
We made it safely back to a place where the water was
calm. My dad and his friend said that it would be safer if
we stayed there.
Everybody laughed. Mom said, “You men will have to
learn a lot before you set out on the big ocean.”
Dad said, “After today, we have learned a good lesson. It
is good to have dreams. But it is really good to test them
out before you act on them.”
Dad’s dream is still to sail around the world one day. He
knows that dreams will come true if you really want them
to. But he also knows that he has a lot to learn before he
sets out on the open ocean.

A Well-Kept Secret
Every once in a while, you hear a story that truly amazes
you. It makes you wonder. And it makes you think.
Here is a story that everyone is talking about. Someone in
the city has been donating money to help fund Seniors’
Homes. But nobody knows who it is.
Twenty years ago, when the first donation arrived, it
seemed a bit out of the ordinary because it wasn’t
common to donate that much money -- over one thousand
yuan. The administrative office tried to contact the person
who named himself Yan Huang. But they found out that
the address and the name provided did not exist. It
seemed that this person simply wished to keep his or her
donation quiet.
Then a few months later, another anonymous donation
arrived, sent from another post office. And then, another.
After many years of receiving the donations, the whole
town was curious to discover the identity of the person
behind these acts of kindness. Was this person rich or
poor?
What motivated him? Why not come forward and be
honoured for what he was doing? A journalist even wrote
an article in the local newspaper with the headline: Where
are you, Yan Huang?
The search continued for many months without results. In
the end, the office received a phone call from somebody
saying that the person only did what anyone should do.
Helping others is worth spending after all, and please stop
looking for him. He did not want to make a name for
himself, or to be recognized for what he did.
So the Seniors’ Home office accepted the fact that they
could never know the person’s true identity. When a
second article in the local newspaper revealed the result
of the search, people were deeply moved and inspired.
Following in his footsteps, many people have started
donating some of their own money to help those with less.
It has become part of their lives.

The Tickets
I had lost my wallet. It had money in it, but far more
importantly, it had two tickets to a World Cup soccer
game!
My aunt gave me these as a special present. She worked
for the organizers and she got the tickets as a special gift.
What was I going to say to my aunt?
I searched for weeks... and nothing.
Months went by and I got a new wallet, but I didn’t have
the heart to tell my aunt that I had lost the tickets. She was
very excited. “Only two months left to the World Cup!” she
would say.
It was terrible.
With less than a week until the World Cup was to start, I
realized it was time for me to confess to my aunt.
I went over to her place and we sat down. I guess she
could see that I was upset. “Aunt Kathy, there’s something
I need to tell you...” She interrupted me. “Good, but before
you do, I was wondering if you know anybody else who
might want some tickets to the big game? I have two
more.”
“This solves my problem!” I thought. As scared as I was, I
didn’t tell the truth. “Sure,” I said. “I can find someone to
give them to.” I took them, but as my hand touched them
and I saw my aunt’s smiling face, I could not lie any
longer.
“Aunt Kathy, I lost the tickets,” I confessed. She looked at
me with an understanding smile and said, “I know. Your
mother told me. It’s all right. I know how bad you felt about
it. It was an accident. It could happen to anyone.”
I could not believe that my aunt was so good to me. She
found two more tickets and pretended not to know that I
had lost the first tickets.
“Now you can still take a friend to the World Cup! Make
sure it’s your best friend!” she laughed. I looked at my
favourite aunt and said, “It is. I’m taking you.”

I Caught a Cold!
I caught a cold. It was really a bad cold. Actually, the
doctor later told me that I had the flu.
My head was pounding. My throat was hurting. My body
was aching. My voice became hoarse and I could hardly
speak. I never experienced anything like this before. Worst
of all, my sore throat was so severe that I couldn’t even
swallow!
I knew I should drink more fluids -- water, soup or juice --
and maybe take some medicine. But I couldn’t. Each time
I tried to swallow, it hurt so much. So my dad took me to
the hospital emergency room.
A doctor came in. He checked my throat. He then checked
my lungs. After his examination, he said, “Nothing to worry
about. You have the flu.”
“Why is it so severe?” I asked. “Can you prescribe me
some medicine so that I don’t suffer as much?”
“No,” the doctor said. “No medicine can cure your flu.
Don’t be sad. Your body is an amazing thing. It will cure
itself without any help.” “What? My body will fix things on
its own?” I exclaimed in disbelief.
“Yes, your body’s immune system will fight the virus for
you. No doctor or medicine will cure you,” repeated the
doctor.
My tears rushed out. I had not realized this in the past.
Everything had always seemed so natural. I’ve gulped
down my meals every day for almost thirteen years. I drink
water like taking a breath -- without thinking about it at all.
Now, I understand that even a simple thing like swallowing
is like a miracle. The muscles and organs in my body do
their jobs amazingly well -- and yet quietly, without me
even noticing.
I don’t remember how many days it took me to heal, but I
do remember what my father told me. He said that we
should all appreciate our bodies and the miracle of how
they are built.

A Movie Full of Memories
Maggie watches a lot of television. Every day she spends
hours in front of the TV. Sometimes, she flips through
channels back and forth and complains that there are no
good programs to watch. Her mother thinks her daughter
watches too much television. One day, she decided to
have a talk with her.
“When I was a little girl, we did not have a television,”
Ms. Hunter said to her daughter. “And there weren’t movie
theatres in every town. In fact, I was nearly ten years old
before I saw my first movie.”
“Ten years old before you saw a movie!” exclaimed
Maggie.
“That’s right,” said her mother. “We lived in a small village.
One day, my father came home from work really excited.
‘There will be a special treat in our village,’ he said. ‘On
the weekend, we are all going to watch a movie.’
“It was difficult waiting all week for that big day to arrive. I
remember talking with my friends and imagining what it
would be like to see a movie.
“Soon the weekend arrived. We could hardly contain our
excitement. Mother got us dressed in our best clothes that
day. And Father talked to us about movies. I remember
sitting, listening to my father and thinking how lucky we
are to be going to a movie.
“When we arrived, there was a big movie screen set up
and a movie projector sitting on a table. We sat on the
grass and made ourselves comfortable. I was shaking with
excitement. All of my friends were too!
“We heard the ‘clickety clacking’ of the projector as it
started up. There was a big burst of music and then a
picture showed up on the screen. It was so amazing to
see a moving picture. I can’t remember what the movie
was. But I will never forget that day.”
Ms. Hunter looked at her daughter and continued, “In
those days, we didn’t have much. But, you see how happy
and content we were. And the day is always
remembered.”
Maggie smiled back at her mother and said, “Thanks for
telling me about this, Mom. I have more to think about.”

How the Porcupine Got Quills
(adapted from a Canadian native story)
All the creatures of the world have ways to protect
themselves from danger. And so it is with the porcupine.
Long ago, as he was walking in the forest, Porcupine met
a black bear. The bear was hungry and decided that
Porcupine would make a good meal.
But Porcupine had other ideas. He ran as fast as he could,
scrambling to the top of a tall tree. Sitting up there and
looking at the bear below, Porcupine realized he needed
some protection. After all, he was small, slow and easy
prey for animals bigger than him.
That day, as Porcupine walked warily in the forest, he
came across a rose bush, and immediately noticed the
sharp thorns on its branches.
Porcupine had an idea. What if he cut some of the sharp
rose branches and wrapped himself in them? He
wondered if that might protect him from the wolf and the
bear. And so Porcupine cut some branches, wrapped
them around his body, and took a walk in the forest.
Suddenly, he crossed paths with Bear, who ran ferociously
towards Porcupine. The little creature lay down and curled
himself into a ball, with only the sharp branches for Bear
to bite into. Bear howled in pain on the first bite of the
cutting thorns inside his mouth. He ran off, leaving
Porcupine to unfurl himself and go about his business.
The creator of the animals was always watching. He saw
how smart the little animal was. He spoke with Porcupine,
telling him that he would attach sharp thorns permanently
to the animal. “They will be called quills. And any who try
to harm you will have a mouthful of sharp quills before
they get to you.”
That afternoon, Wolf came along. He too had been trying
to eat Porcupine. He lunged at Porcupine, his mouth wide
open. He immediately ran off screaming in pain as the
sharp quills cut into his tender mouth.
In the distance, Porcupine noticed Bear watching him. But
Bear had learned his lesson the hard way. From that day
on, neither Bear, nor Wolf, nor any other creature
threatened the intelligent Porcupine.

Faster Than the Internet!
I live with my family in Canada. We are Chinese. Like
people everywhere who have moved to a new country, my
parents always encourage me to stay in touch with things
that are happening back home.
Satellite television makes things a lot easier. But we do
not have a satellite yet. My parents read the newspapers
when they can get them, and I like to get news from the
Internet.
When the 2004 Summer Olympics were on, we wanted to
know how the Chinese team was doing. And we did not
want to wait until the next day to hear the results.
My brother loves the hurdles. I like the hurdles, too. And
our mom and dad just like to keep up with the news at
home.
Naturally, we are all very interested in Liu Xiang. He’s
China’s best hurdler. It is the first time that a Chinese
hurdler has made it to the Olympic finals.
His race was not shown on TV here in Canada. So we
decided to follow it on the Internet. My brother found the
race on the Internet. We gathered around the computer.
We were all very excited, waiting for the start of the race.
Who would win?
The first message we got was that the racers were all
lined up at the starting line. We imagined the excitement at
the starting line. We all waited with anticipation.
Then a message: “The race has begun.” The next
message was: “He wins!”
The race was over. We all laughed. In the time it took to
blink our eyes, Liu Xiang had passed the finish line.
The Internet is fast. But Liu Xiang is faster.

Growing Lesson
Mr. Worth liked spending time with his grandson, Shawn.
He enjoyed teaching him some of the things he may not
be taught in school. Grandfathers have a special
relationship with their grandchildren. They can often pass
down some wisdom that will be helpful to the younger
generations.
One day, while he was visiting, the boy came running into
the house. He told his grandfather about a class science
project that he was very excited about.
Each student was going to grow a pot of bean plants.
When the plants grew big and strong, the students were to
plant them in a garden at the school. They each wanted to
grow the strongest and best bean plant.
Shawn showed his grandfather the bean seeds. He
explained that his teacher taught them how to make the
seeds grow. First, they put the seeds on a wet paper
towel. Then, they put them near a warm window. When
the seeds sprout, they are ready to be transplanted into a
pot.
After listening to his grandson, Mr. Worth said, “You do
just as you learned, but I want to show you one extra thing
about growing plants.”
“When I was a boy, my father showed me how to grow
strong plants,” he continued. “When the plant is starting
out, you put some weight on it.” Shawn looked at his
grandfather in disbelief.
“Doesn’t the weight stop the bean from growing?” he
asked.
“No, of course not. This way, you will force the bean plant
to be strong and healthy. If you give it everything it wants,
it will grow too fast and it will be weak. It will fall over when
the first big wind blows.”
Shawn listened carefully. He was eager to grow the bean
in the way Grandfather described. He could hardly wait to
tell his friends what he had learned that day.

What Will Be, Will Be
(adapted from a traditional Chinese tale)
A long time ago, in the north of China, there lived an old
man. He raised the finest horses in all the land. His family
was happy and he was rich in friends too.
One night, the man’s prized horse, a big black stallion,
disappeared. The old man was sad as it was the finest in
his possession. Friends from all over the district came to
say how sorry they were. The old man said only, “What will
be, will be.” And he went on with his work.
Months later, the villagers saw the black stallion coming
home, leading two beautiful white horses. The village
raised a cheer, happy for the return of the old man’s horse
and the addition of two more. The old farmer thanked
them for their happiness and said quietly for all to hear,
“What will be, will be.” And he went back to his work.
The old man’s only son loved horses, so it was natural for
the old man to give his son the black stallion. The old man
began to teach his son to ride.
Unfortunately, on his first lesson, the boy fell from the
horse and broke his leg. The boy could not walk. No one
knew if he would ever walk again. Everyone was
saddened, and came to tell the old man how sad they
were. The old man just looked at them and said, “What will
be, will be.” And he returned to his work.
In a few weeks, angry tribes from the far north invaded the
land. The king sent his emissaries to enlist one male child
from each family to fight against the invaders. When they
arrived at the old man’s village, they took one son from
each home.
At the home of the old man, they found the crippled boy,
the only son. Since he was not fit for fighting, they did not
take him and left the village.
As he watched the soldiers marching away over the dusty
plains, the old man whispered to himself, “What will be,
will be.” And he went on with his work.

Why We Cry
When you were a baby, if things weren’t going your way,
you probably cried. Big salty tears poured down your face.
Adults knew that something was wrong. You were angry or
hungry, and crying was your way of showing it.
You probably don’t cry too much now that you are older.
But, did you know that your body never stops making
tears? You don’t feel them, but they are there. Tears of this
kind are always cleaning and feeding your eyes. If they
were not there, our eyes would quickly dry out and vision
would soon be lost.
Have you ever had a piece of dirt or a small stick hit your
eye while playing? Your body immediately fights back. It
sends tears into your eyes to get rid of the dirt.
Tears are made by tear ducts located behind each eye,
under the eyelid. Our body mixes many chemicals to
create a tear. One of the main ingredients in a tear is
“sodium”-- better known as salt. This is why tears taste
salty.
Mammals of every kind produce cleansing tears. But only
humans make tears when they are sad. Watching a sad
movie might make you cry. Saying goodbye to a good
friend who is moving to another city might make you cry.
Sometimes, you’re having a great time with your friends.
You laugh so hard that you start to cry. Yes, tears are not
just for sadness. Many of us cry when we are happy too.
Nature gives us many tools to keep us healthy. Tears are
just one of the tools that we cannot live without.

Renewable Living
The Warrens are an ordinary family -- two parents, a son
and a daughter. However, this ordinary family has done
something extraordinary. A few years ago, they sold their
big suburban house and moved to the countryside.
But that’s not the only thing special they did. They built a
small house which was powered by wind!
Mr. Warren had been reading about all the problems with
the electrical system. He wanted his family to play a small
part in saving our planet.
The Warrens decided to make their own electricity to
power everything they needed for their daily lives.
The kids were worried at first. “Will we still be able to have
a television?” asked the daughter, Jane. “What about my
computer?” asked James, the son. “Don’t worry at all,”
said their father. “Just because we are going to generate
our own power using the wind and the sun, doesn’t mean
we have to live in the Dark Ages.”
“We are going to set up a wind generator,” explained Mrs.
Warren. “The wind is a great way to make electricity. It’s
free. It’s clean. And it blows really well at our new home. It
doesn’t blow every day though. That’s why we need to
have some batteries to store our power. When the wind
blows, it charges our batteries. When there is no wind, we
still have power in our batteries to run everything in our
house.”
Mr. Warren added, “We are also going to have two solar
panels. They will collect the energy from the sun and turn
it into electricity, too. So, when the wind blows, we have
power. When the sun shines, we have power too.”
It was easy to see that Mr. Warren really believed in
renewable energy. And all his family agreed with him.
Now, the Warren family lives in this self-powered
countryside home. They generate their own electricity.
They are more aware of the power they use now. They
turn off lights when they leave a room. And they use
energy-efficient appliances such as their stove and fridge.
They live happily in this energy self-sufficient special
house.

A Driving Lesson
One night, my family was driving back from visiting my
uncle in the middle of a very bad snowstorm.
The road was normally two lanes going in each direction,
but there was so much snow that it was down to one lane.
We were scared, but we felt safe because my father used
to work as a truck driver. He’s a very safe driver.
We were all alone on the highway until three cars pulled
up right behind us. They flashed their lights and beeped
their horns, wanting to get by us, but there was no place
for us to pull over.
After a while, we stopped at a restaurant to wait for the
storm to calm down.
The three cars behind us pulled in too. They were full of
teenagers. They were talking about how slow we were
driving. One of them said loudly enough for us to hear, “If
you don’t know how to drive, you shouldn’t be on the
highway.”
Soon after, the teenagers left even though the storm was
getting worse. My father decided that we should wait
inside, hoping the storm would ease.
After it cleared a little, we headed down the road.
Eventually, we came around a bend. We could not believe
our eyes -- the three cars were all in the ditch!
Dad ran to the cars. The kids were all okay, but they were
freezing and very frightened. A police officer arrived and
took some of the kids to the next gas station. We gave two
of them a ride.
It was a very quiet drive. My dad turned to the teenage
driver and said with a little smile, “You know, if you don’t
know how to drive, you should stay off the road.”
The boy was very embarrassed. My dad smiled and said,
“I was a truck driver for fifteen years and we had a saying:
There are old drivers and there are bold drivers, but there
aren’t any old bold drivers.”
The boy understood and hung his head in shame.

Coat of Many Colours
(adapted from a Bible story)
Joseph was born into a large family. He was a good and
faithful son, and his father favoured him over all his other
children. All day, Joseph was at his father’s side while his
brothers worked in the fields.
Choosing the finest material in the land, Joseph’s father
even made a beautiful coat for his son. All the colours of
the rainbow were in this coat. It was, in fact, known as the
coat of many colours. Joseph wore it proudly for it showed
that he was his father’s favourite son.
The brothers came to resent Joseph. “He is lazy,”
complained one brother. “He gets everything and we get
nothing,” said another brother as they worked in the hot
fields. “This is not fair,” said another brother angrily.
The brothers grumbled among themselves. They decided
to take action against their brother. “Let us kill him,” they
said. So they waited for their chance.
As luck would have it, that very day, Joseph’s father sent
him to the fields to give a message to his other sons. As
Joseph approached, the brothers decided that the time
was right to act. “Let us grab him when he comes, but we
will not kill him. We will throw him in this deep hole and tell
our father that he has disappeared.”
They grabbed their brother and ripped his beautiful coat
from him. They beat him and threw him into the hole.
They covered the coat with blood from a sheep and
returned to their father. Their father was heartbroken. He
cried for his missing son. But Joseph did not return home.
Some men from another place were walking in the desert
and heard a frightened voice calling from the deep hole. It
was Joseph. The men pulled him out from the hole. They
laughed when they saw the boy.
They took him out of his country and sold him as a slave.
But one day, far ahead in the future, Joseph would return
as a grown man. He would reclaim his coat of many
colours.

Collecting Things
Do you have a passion for finding and keeping certain
things?
You do? Don’t worry. It’s very common for youngsters to
collect things. In fact, scientists have uncovered the bones
of cave people from 10,000 years ago and found little
boys with collections of shiny things buried beside them.
I guess the art of collecting goes back a long way.
When I was about ten years old, I collected comic books.
In fact, I was crazy about comic books! I used to buy them
and trade them. One time, I used my lunch money to buy
comics. I got into a lot of trouble for that. My mother
wouldn’t let me play outside for a week because I had
been so foolish.
At one time, I had more than 600 comic books! I kept them
in a place of honour on my shelf. I would show them off to
anyone who came to visit. I was very proud of them until
one day a friend came to my house with another friend of
his.
I showed his friend my collection and he laughed, saying
that it was a childish thing to do. “I gave up comic books
years ago!” he said. I was very embarrassed. The next
day, I put all my comics away and didn’t look at them
again for fifteen years.
Years later, I heard that a person had just paid 500 dollars
for a specific comic book. I could not believe it! I knew I
had that comic book in my collection. It turned out that I
had many more comics that were worth a lot of money.
I sold them all and made thousands of dollars, but I still
kept my favourite ones. They’re very special to me. I’ll
never sell them.
What did I learn from this childhood experience? Don’t
ever let anyone tell you that what you do is foolish.
Remember, it’s your life. Who knows? You may end up
with a hobby that will actually pay you!

Getting Fire Under Control
In modern times, making a fire is easy. Strike a match, and
there you have it a nice hot flame. But it wasn’t always so
easy.
Long ago, in prehistoric times, humans did not have fire
under control. They lived in a dark, cold world. Nothing to
use for cooking food. Nothing to light the way at night.
And most importantly, nothing to keep them warm.
There were lots of natural fires in the prehistoric era.
Lightning would strike the earth, frequently causing fires.
Cavemen might come across a burning tree that had been
set a fire by lightning.
By trial and error, they learned that fire was good. The
next big step was learning how to control fire. So humans
had to find fire, and then learn how to keep it burning.
They also needed to learn how to keep the fire under
control, so it would not burn things that they did not want
to burn.
Soon, they figured out how to light a stick using a natural
fire and keep it burning for a long time. They carried a
burning coal from the fire and took it to a place where they
wanted to make a new fire.
They appointed someone in their group to become the fire
keeper. His job was to keep the fires burning. When the
cavemen moved to a new place, the fire keeper would
bring the hot coals and make a new fire. Nothing was
perfect, though. Sometimes, the fire keeper could not
keep the fire going. Rain might come and wash it away.
The cavemen would then have to find a new fire. They
might steal fire from another group of cavemen living
nearby.
Eventually, someone figured out that they could make a
fire by rubbing sticks together or by breaking special
stones to make sparks. This changed everything for
prehistoric humans. They could make a fire whenever they
needed one.
Humans then had total control of fire. This would change
the way they lived forever.
