  <div class="myclass">
    It was the last math exam before summer. But Scott didn’t
    worry. He was the best math student in the class, and he
    never had to work very hard at it. It used to make the other
    students mad because he never studied, yet he always
    got the best mark.
    As usual, he was the first one done. The next day, a call
    came to his house and he was asked to go to the school.
    “But school is over and it’s summertime now!” he thought.
    When he arrived at the school, his parents, the math
    teacher and the principal were there to meet him. “Wow!”
    he thought. “I must have scored 100 percent on the
    exam!”
    Sure enough, the principal said the meeting was about his
    math exam. But what he said next left Scott stunned. “You
    failed,” the principal said. “Since you were a little kid, you
    have found math easy. But now you are at the point where
    you have taken your talent in math and wasted it. It’s time
    you learned that you couldn’t just walk into an exam
    unprepared.”
    The principal continued, “I was like you when I was a boy.
    My gift was in science. I didn’t need to study for science at
    all. I was the class ace. But one day, I failed a big exam.
    You see this picture? It was given to me by my science
    teacher that day. This ugly-looking bird is called a buzzard.
    Read what it says at the bottom.”
    Scott read it aloud, “Welcome to the Buzzard Club.
    Remember, it’s not about brains. It’s about hard work.”
    “A buzzard can only fly if it gets a running start,” the
    principal explained. “It can’t just leap into the air like other
    birds. But once it’s in the air, it can soar to great heights.
    Keep this bird in mind. Remember, studying is like that
    running start. Combined with your natural ability, it will
    allow you to fly like a bird!”
    Scott became a proud member of the Buzzard Club. And
    he never failed a math exam again.

    Terry Fox: An Inspiration (I)
    He was only seventeen years old when he got the horrible
    news. Cancer. The word must have frightened the young
    high school student as he listened to his doctor.
    He had plans, you know. All youngsters do as they make
    their way through high school and begin to think about
    their futures. He must have felt hopeless that day in his
    doctor’s office.
    A month before, he had been in a minor car accident.
    He had some pain in his right knee. But being a typical
    young boy, he ignored the pain. When he developed a
    noticeable limp, he could no longer pretend that
    everything was okay. His mother insisted on taking him to
    the doctor. A few days later, Terry found out that he had a
    rare form of cancer. His right leg would have to be
    amputated 6 inches above the knee.
    As he lay on his bed the night before his operation, Terry
    could easily have given up. Life must have seemed terribly
    unfair. His friends were thinking about their final year in
    high school, and he was thinking about losing his leg the
    next morning.
    But, instead of hopelessness, hope seemed to take over
    the young man’s mind. Instead of thinking “why me”, Terry
    Fox made up his mind to make the best of a bad situation.
    He would meet the challenge head-on. He would make it
    through the operation.
    After the surgery, he received his artificial leg and learned
    how to use it. He decided to work day and night to
    become a long-distance runner. What a dream!
    Imagine how difficult this must have been. Think about
    balance. Think about strength. Think about determination
    and dedication. But Terry did not think about giving up. He
    was going to do something about cancer. It had hit him,
    and he was going to fight back.
    Impossible as it seemed, he was going to run across
    Canada, all the way from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific
    Ocean. He was going to run 50 kilometres a day for six
    months. He hoped to raise one million dollars for cancer
    research. Few believed he would make it.
    But the young man from Canada had a dream.
    10-3
    Terry Fox: An Inspiration (II)
    On April12, 1980, after many months of training, Terry Fox
    dipped his leg into the Atlantic Ocean and began his
    Marathon of Hope. Almost no one showed up to see him
    begin his journey. For the first days of his marathon, Terry
    Fox was alone -- a lonely young man determined to reach
    his goal.
    He got up early and started running at 4:30 a.m. Only 500
    kilometres into his run, Terry began to feel sick. He could
    easily have given up right there. But this was no typical
    young man. He was fighting back and doing something for
    others. How could he quit? The word “quit” did not seem to
    be part of his vocabulary.
    As the days wore on, Canadians began to sense that
    something big was happening out there on the lonely
    road. As people saw Terry slowly hopping along in his
    strange running gait, they stopped and donated money for
    cancer research. By the time he reached central Canada,
    Canadians had come to love and admire this brave young
    man. They seemed to understand the courage it required.
    When he hit Toronto, thousands of people lined the streets
    to watch him. Money began to pour in, and all seemed
    well for the Marathon of Hope.
    But even heroes like Terry Fox don’t always beat the odds.
    As Terry reached Thunder Bay, Ontario, his health took a
    rapid turn for the worse. He finally checked into a hospital
    and was given bad news for the second time in his life.
    The cancer had returned. It was in his lungs now. He
    seemed to know that he wouldn’t live much longer. He had
    to give up his marathon on September 1, 1980, and begin
    cancer therapy once again.
    Terry died a few months later. He was only 22 years old. In
    his short life, he raised $24 million for cancer research –
    one dollar for every Canadian.
    Many years after his death, people from nations all over
    the world have held Terry Fox marathons and raised
    hundreds of millions of dollars.

    The Big Leap
    I don’t like heights. I never have. I don’t mind being in a
    tall building or on a plane. But looking out over the edge of
    a cliff, or even down from a tree, makes me feel a little
    dizzy.
    I mention this because it has a lot to do with something
    that happened to me a few years ago. I was with my
    friends at a lake, and we were having a good time
    swimming, canoeing, and playing cards.
    On one of our canoe trips, we came across a huge rock. It
    was much taller than a house, and it was right beside the
    water. The other kids thought it would be a great place for
    swimming. “It even has a perfect jumping rock!” said one
    of my friends.
    You can imagine my reaction. I never told my friends
    about my fear of heights. There was no way I was jumping
    off that rock!
    I got in the water and swam around. I was the best
    swimmer, so I thought just in case something happened I
    would be in the water to help.
    Everyone jumped off the rock many times, except me.
    “Hey John! You haven’t jumped yet,” said one of the girls.
    “Are you scared?” joked one of the boys. Soon, they were
    all chanting, “Jump, jump, jump!”
    I was too embarrassed to admit my fear. So I climbed the
    rock. Everyone was watching as I looked over the edge.
    Only Wendy was in the water far below. I just couldn’t do
    it.
    Suddenly, a branch fell and hit Wendy on her head. I
    called to her, but she didn’t answer. I was the closest
    person to her and the best swimmer. I had no choice.
    I jumped. Actually, I dove in to get close to her more
    quickly. At that moment, I lost all fear. I pulled her to the
    shore. She coughed a little, but she was fine.
    I still don’t like heights, but I was amazed at what I did to
    help another person. I guess you never know what you’re
    capable of when someone needs your help.

    Rock Paper Scissors: Let’s Have Fun
    My father took us on a cross-country train tour. We were
    on the train for several days. My brother and I were really
    excited the first day. We were watching the countryside roll
    by outside, talking to passengers in nearby seats, and
    sleeping in bunk beds.
    But soon, the novelty wore off. On the second day, my
    brother cried, “We’re bored!” Dad replied, “Bored? I will not
    tolerate that. Just because you can’t play on the computer
    doesn’t mean there’s nothing to do.”
    He suggested that we play a game he used to play when
    he was a boy. “This game is called Rock, Paper, Scissors.
    You don’t need anything to play it,” he explained. “All the
    kids in my village loved playing. It’s really easy, and it
    helps you concentrate, too.”
    Then, he showed us how to play the game. There are
    three moves. A hand closed like a fist is a rock. A hand
    flat, with all fingers touching, is paper. And a hand with two
    fingers out like a pair of scissors is, of course, scissors.
    Easy, right? That’s all there is to it. You raise your hand
    above your head, count to three, and bring down your
    hand in one of the three gestures. Here’s how to
    determine the winner. Rock breaks scissors, paper covers
    rock, and scissors cut paper. Not complicated at all!
    Of course, all the hands have to come out at the same
    time. So you all call out “Rock, paper, scissors!” On the
    last one, you show your hand with one of the three
    gestures. Let’s say you bring down a rock, and your
    opponent brings down scissors. The rock breaks the
    scissors and you win. If you both bring down the same
    gesture, it’s a tie.
    We started playing right away. “Rock, paper, scissors!” I
    won! “Again,” my brother begged. We played the game
    with my brother, my father, and nearby passengers. We
    laughed a lot.
    We love this game. It’s simple, but fun. You can play it
    anytime and anywhere.
    And yet, it’s psychological, it’s mental and it requires
    concentration, too.

    Giant Sunflower
    Every year in autumn, the fair comes to our town. There
    are rides like the Ferris wheel and bumper cars. There are
    games to play. And best of all, there are competitions.
    You can win a ribbon for making the best cookies. You can
    win a ribbon for growing the best vegetables. In fact, there
    are prizes for almost everything you can think of.
    I love to grow sunflowers. In our backyard, every year
    since I was only five years old, I plant some seeds. You
    would be surprised how BIG those little seeds can grow.
    Every year, my mom says that I should enter my
    sunflowers in the fair. There is a contest for growing the
    tallest sunflower. This year, I decided to take up the
    challenge.
    In May, I planted my seeds. I carefully tended my
    sunflowers. I watered them every day. By the end of June,
    one plant was nearly a metre tall already. Imagine that! By
    the end of July, when I measured this sunflower, I needed
    a ladder to reach the top.
    Finally, the day of the fair arrived. My sunflower was 3
    metres and 87 centimetres tall. Wow! I cut my sunflower
    the morning of the fair. I took it over to the fair and entered
    it into the competition.
    Then, it was the long wait for the judging to begin. I was
    nervous. I wanted to take home the red ribbon, the
    winning prize. I could hardly wait until 4 o’clock.
    Finally, the moment arrived. I went to the building and
    there it was! My sunflower was standing there with the
    winning red ribbon. I was happy. Really happy!
    Mom gave me a big hug. “See,” she said. “I knew my girl
    was a good gardener. Now you have a ribbon to prove it.”
    I went home happy. I hung the ribbon on my wall. It will
    remind me all winter that gardening is really a fun thing to
    do.

    The Sahara Desert: Shifting “Sandscape”
    Hot days with temperatures soaring above 40°C, nights of
    extreme cold, small bands of nomadic people travelling
    across a barren territory with only the stars to guide them.
    Welcome to the Sahara, the world’s largest hot desert,
    covering more than nine million square kilometres across
    North Africa.
    The Sahara is a complex ecosystem bound by its dry,
    harsh climate. It is known as one of the toughest places
    on Earth. A mistake on the Sahara can cost you your life.
    People perish without water. You either carry enough
    water with you, or you know exactly where and how to find
    it.
    Any area of land where the annual rainfall is less than 250
    mm is officially classified as a desert. It’s the lack of water
    -- not the sand -- that makes a desert a desert. In fact, you
    might be surprised to learn that only 25 percent of the
    Sahara is covered with sand.
    Although it occupies an area almost as big as Canada, the
    Sahara is one of the least populated places on Earth. Less
    than two and a half million people live there. Most of them
    are nomads -- people with no permanent home. They are
    known as Bedouin, the Arabic word for “desert dwellers”.
    They are mostly descendants of Arabs who migrated west
    from their desert kingdoms. Everything they need for
    survival, they carry with them.
    These nomads live in small family groups and are
    constantly on the move. Age-old wisdom about how to live
    in the Sahara has been passed down from generation to
    generation. Often you can find Bedouin in places where
    water is abundant, and date trees provide shade and a
    welcome rest. Goats, sheep, and camels provide food and
    transport.
    It’s hard to imagine, but the Sahara desert was once
    covered in ice during the last Ice Age. Thousands of years
    later, the ice melted, leaving fertile grasslands. Slowly,
    changes in the climate transformed the land from lush and
    tropical to the desert we know today.
    The story of the Sahara is indeed the story of shifting
    sands.

    What Will You Do When You’re 90?
    If you were 90 years old, what would you plan to do? Few
    people want to take up new challenges at that age. This is
    the story of one old man who did something that surprised
    a lot of people.
    At the age of 93, he accepted an invitation to play the role
    of the number one male actor in The Barber, a movie
    about the life of an old barber. Although he was familiar
    with the story, he needed to memorize all the lines in the
    script. He needed to live with the crew for many days. And
    he needed to act. What an enormous challenge!
    His name is Jing Kui. He still lives in his own home in
    Beijing. He met the challenge and successfully finished
    the film. On top of that, the movie won both national and
    international awards. Mr. Jing took home a trophy for a
    special acting prize.
    Mr. Jing has been a barber all his life. Born in 1913, he
    began his apprenticeship at age sixteen. When he was 88,
    he was still doing the same job. The only change was that
    he began to travel from home to home to serve his loyal
    customers. Most of them were senior citizens. He cut hair
    and shaved beards, using a traditional razor blade. In fact,
    all his tools were manual.
    Imagine an old man with a full head of grey hair and a
    curved back, working smoothly -- cutting, clipping,
    shaving, and washing. You would be touched by the
    scene. That’s how he attracted the attention of the film
    director, who decided to make a film about him.
    At age 93, the old barber began his movie adventure.
    Each day, he got up early to rehearse the script.
    Memorizing the lines was a big challenge. He worked hard
    at it, for he didn’t want to disappoint the director. The
    movie director was nervous throughout the entire process
    because he didn’t know whether Mr. Jing could keep it
    going until the filming was done. But Mr. Jing surpassed
    both his own and the director’s expectations.
    The two set a world record in the movie industry by having
    a non-professional 93-year-old actor star in an award-
    winning film.

    Expect the Unexpected
    I used to live in a beautiful house. The view was
    incredible. You could see for miles out over the ocean.
    Ships, surfers, and sailboats passed in front of our window
    every day.
    My father built the house 50 years ago. At the time, it was
    considered very unusual because it hung over a cliff and
    faced the ocean. It was supported by large metal beams
    that hung over the water. He was told by many experts,
    “Don’t build your house like that. It will fall in an
    earthquake.”
    Over the years, we had many earthquakes. Some were
    big, but most were small. One time, an earthquake
    actually cracked one of the supports that held up the
    house. But it didn’t fall.
    My dad was a good designer, and for over 50 years his
    house never moved, while others fell. But even his good
    design could not protect us from what was coming one hot
    summer.
    The winds had been hot and dry that summer. One day,
    there was a loud knock on the door. It was a policeman.
    He said that we had been ordered out of our home. There
    was a huge forest fire only a few hours away. We were
    told to take everything we wanted and evacuate
    immediately.
    That’s a very hard situation to be in. Imagine you have
    only enough room in your car to take a few of your things.
    It’s not easy for sure.
    We got our stuff and headed out. The next day we were
    allowed back. It was the hardest day of my life. Our house
    was gone.
    I approached my dad, and he was smiling with a tear in
    his eye. “Look,” he said.
    I looked over to where he was pointing and the only things
    remaining were those metal supports hanging over the
    water.
    In that moment, I understood what an amazing man my
    father was.

    Galileo: Father of Modern Science
    In Europe during the 16th and 17th centuries, society was
    entering the scientific age. Many ancient beliefs were
    being questioned and proven false. For example, up until
    this era, many people believed that the earth was flat.
    They also believed that the earth was the centre of the
    universe.
    Galileo Galilei, an Italian astronomer and mathematician,
    was at the forefront of this movement, which came to be
    known as the Scientific Revolution. Galileo’s inquisitive
    mind and keen observation skills made him the most
    famous scientist of his time.
    His ideas also put him in danger of being killed. He was,
    after all, questioning the beliefs of some of the most
    powerful men of his time. For more than 1,500 years,
    Europeans had believed that the sun, the planets and all
    heavenly objects travelled around the earth.
    In 1609, Galileo built one of the world’s first telescopes. It
    was capable of magnifying objects by a power of three. He
    soon improved this design by building a telescope with 30
    times the magnification. With these inventions, he ushered
    in the age of modern astronomy.
    On a cold January night in 1610, with the benefit of this
    new powerful telescope, Galileo saw something that
    changed people’s understanding of the world. He
    observed that Jupiter had four moons travelling around it.
    If heavenly objects orbited Jupiter, then the idea that
    everything orbited the earth must be incorrect.
    It was soon clear to Galileo that the earth could not be the
    centre of the universe. This conclusion got him into a lot of
    trouble with powerful church leaders. He was called to
    Rome to face a legal tribunal, where he was warned not to
    say or publish anything about his new idea.
    But Galileo could not hold his tongue forever. A few years
    later, he published his theory in a popular book. He was
    again put on trial, and could have been sentenced to
    death by burning at the stake. However, he was
    sentenced to house arrest for the remainder of his life. He
    died under house arrest at the age of 77, in 1642.
    Galileo Galilei suffered much during his life. But he later
    achieved world recognition, which he truly deserved.

    The Wise Old Crow
    (adapted from a traditional European legend)
    It was the middle of summer on a tiny little island in the
    sea. And it was so hot that all the fresh water had dried
    up. The birds were so weak that they could hardly fly.
    Then one night, it rained. But the ground was so hard and
    dry that the water just ran into the sea.
    All the birds were beginning to panic. Then, an old crow
    announced, “Last week, some humans left a very large
    round bottle on the beach. It may have water in it.”
    Someone yelled, “Take us there, old crow!”
    He took them to the beach, and they all stood looking at
    the huge round bottle. It was sitting upright on the sand. It
    had gallons of water in it -- all they would need for weeks.
    They tried to push it over, but it was so big that it would
    not move. They dropped rocks on it, but it would not
    break. They all felt they would die looking at the fresh
    water!
    As they argued about how to break the bottle, the old crow
    picked up a pebble and walked over to the bottle.
    “What are you doing, crazy old bird?” someone said.
    “You’ll never be able to smash it with one of those little
    pebbles.” They all laughed at him. “You’re probably right,”
    said the old crow.
    He walked over to the bottle and dropped the pebble in.
    The others went back to arguing while he continued to
    drop pebbles into the bottle. Suddenly, one crow noticed
    and said, “Look, the water is rising!”
    The wise old crow declared, “If we cannot reach the water,
    we must bring the water to us.”
    Soon, all the birds were helping. It took hundreds of
    pebbles, but by noon, the water had come to the top.
    Everyone agreed that the first drink should go to the wise
    old crow who had saved them.
    The old crow is an important reminder that with age comes
    wisdom.

    The Bicycle Man
    The neighbourhood children all love old man Wang Zu.
    They always wave and shout to him as he rides his
    antique bicycle around town -- his back straight as an
    arrow and his legs strong as those of a man 30 years
    younger than him.
    Wang is known throughout the town as “the bicycle man”.
    He wears his nickname proudly, for there is nothing he
    loves more than bicycles. His knowledge of the history of
    bicycles is deep, making him a sort of amateur expert.
    Throughout his long life, Wang has devoted much of his
    spare time to learning everything he can about bicycles.
    He has a good job and a happy family. But he always finds
    time for his passion for bicycles.
    On weekends, you can find him at his little garage, where
    he repairs bicycles for children, the elderly, and anyone
    else who needs his assistance.
    Wang never accepts payment for his repair services.
    When people come with broken chains and flat tires, he
    tells them that the great pleasure he gets from working on
    their bicycles is more than enough compensation.
    Well into his seventies, Wang has seen many changes.
    When he was a boy, bicycles were expensive and seemed
    unobtainable for ordinary people. Wang dreamed of the
    day when he might own one.
    “Yes, indeed,” Mr. Wang often says to the children who
    gather at his shop to listen to his stories. “Everyone
    wanted a bike. It was a sign of wealth. When I met my
    wife, the first thing she asked me was whether I owned a
    bicycle. It was her way of finding out if I was up to the task
    of raising a family.”
    When children ride their bicycles today, they have no idea
    of the history behind the machine. Most of them have
    never thought about where a bicycle comes from. Did it
    always look as it does today? What have improvements
    been made over the years? Will the bike survive?
    There was one thing the children wanted to do -- they
    would ask their teacher to invite Wang to give a talk about
    the history and evolution of bicycles.

    Racism Has No Place in Sport
    Have you heard the inspiring story about a runner who
    made history at the Olympic Games in Berlin, Germany in
    1936? At this time, the world was on the verge of war.
    There was much hatred and fear.
    But athletics and sportsmanship proved that on the field,
    skin colour did not matter. Listen to what happened that
    day in Berlin.
    There were two outstanding athletes competing in the long
    jump. One was a German athlete, Lutz Long. The other
    was an African-American, Jesse Owens.
    A Nazi government was in power in Germany. Its leader,
    Adolph Hitler, wanted Lutz Long to defeat the American
    and prove that white people were better than the others.
    In his last jump, Jesse Owens defeated the German. Hitler
    left the podium before the medal ceremony.
    The German athlete, Long, did not share his leader’s
    prejudice. Although he lost to the American, the German
    went over to congratulate the winner. The two long
    jumpers walked off the field, arm in arm. There was no
    place in the hearts of either man for Hitler’s racism.
    Jesse Owens went on to be the hero of the Berlin Games,
    winning four gold medals.
    Owens said he wasn’t bothered by Hitler’s actions. “I didn’t
    go to Berlin to shake hands with him anyway,” was his
    comment.
    In fact, Germany wasn’t the only country in the world
    where people experienced racism. In another famous
    quote Owens said, “I wasn’t invited to shake hands with
    Hitler. But I wasn’t invited to the White House to shake
    hands with the President either.”
    Sometimes, it takes two common people to join hands in
    the spirit of sport to teach the world about equality and
    fairness.

    Migration: A Natural Instinct
    Each spring, as the winter snows are melting, a familiar
    sound is heard in the skies over Canada. It’s the loud
    honking of geese heading to their summer breeding
    grounds. A few months later, winter approaches, and the
    lakes begin to freeze. The skies are once again filled with
    the sound of geese, this time heading in the other
    direction. They are on their way south to their warm
    wintering grounds.
    This twice-a-year migration of huge flocks of Canada
    geese is mysterious and little understood. Science has no
    explanation for why, or even how, it happens.
    Life in the natural world is filled with many wonders like
    this. Much of what we see in nature can be easily
    explained. There are some things, however, that science
    can observe and record, but cannot really understand.
    Canada geese spend the winter in the warm climates of
    the southern United States and Mexico, where food is
    plentiful. As winter ends in Canada, something tells them
    it’s time to begin their flight north, where they will spend
    the summer in the plentiful Arctic region of their birth.
    When they get there, they build their nests, lay eggs, and
    raise a new family. Adult Canada geese mate for life. One
    male and one female spend about twenty years together
    and raise an average of 75 chicks over their lifetime. Each
    of these chicks comes into the world “hard-wired” with this
    amazing ability to find its way home.
    At the end of summer, they gather in flocks containing
    thousands of birds, and return south following the same
    route that they and their ancestors have been following for
    thousands of generations.
    How do they find their way? What signals lead them as
    they fly at speeds of 80 kilometres an hour for fifteen
    hours a day? How do they know winter is over in Canada?
    These are just some of the questions that can’t be fully
    answered by current research on migration and the
    homing instinct.
    They are just some of nature’s miracles that humans
    cannot understand.

    The Shepherd and the Sheep
    Have you ever been lost? How frightening that would be!
    When I was just a little boy, I used to visit my grandparents
    on their farm, far from the city. My grandfather was a
    shepherd. That means he was a sheep farmer. He looked
    after the sheep. He kept them safe and protected them
    from wolves and other wild animals in the forest.
    Each morning, Grandfather gathered the sheep and we
    set off for distant fields. The sheep stayed together, eating
    grass under the watchful eye of Grandpa.
    One day, as we were guarding the sheep, Grandpa asked
    me what I would do if one of these sheep were to get lost.
    “Would you go to look for it?” he asked. “I am not sure,” I
    replied. “If I went off to look for that one lost sheep, all
    these others would be alone and unprotected while I was
    gone.”
    Grandpa said, “You are wise, my grandson. But how do
    you think that lost sheep would feel all alone, lost in the
    wild without its fellow sheep? Don’t you think it would be
    frightened? A shepherd loves and protects all of his sheep.
    It is not easy to leave the whole flock to go in search of
    just one that is lost. That is the job of a shepherd. He will
    not rest as long as one of his sheep is lost or in danger.”
    The more I thought about what he said, the more I
    realized how true it was. If I were lost, I would want my
    parents to come for me, even if they had to leave my
    brothers and sisters alone while they searched.
    When I grew up, I heard the bible story about the
    shepherd and one lost sheep. Jesus told the story to the
    people to explain how important each and every person is
    to God.
    As long as one person is in danger, the shepherd does
    whatever it takes to bring that person back safely to the
    flock.

    The First Lady of the Air (I)
    Amelia Earhart is one of the world’s most celebrated
    aviators. She is remembered today as a pioneer of
    airplane travel and the greatest female pilot of her day.
    Her accomplishments in the field of aviation inspired
    others and helped pave the way for those that followed.
    Amelia was born in Kansas, on July 24, 1897. When she
    graduated from high school in 1916, she travelled to
    Canada and worked as a nurse and an English teacher.
    Upon returning to her home in the U.S., she entered
    college. But her stay there was short. Amelia Earhart was
    about to enter the pages of history.
    One day, her father took her to an air show where she
    watched pilots showing off their flying skills. She
    immediately fell in love with airplanes. The next day, at
    only 24 years of age, she made her first flight. A year later,
    against the wishes of her family, she made her first solo
    flight.
    She soon purchased her own airplane. For the rest of her
    adventurous life, she was a woman in a man’s world.
    People in those days believed that only men should be
    piloting these new “flying machines”. Of course, Amelia did
    not agree with this idea.
    Amelia Earhart set many “firsts” in the early days of
    airplane travel -- and not just as a female pilot. She
    earned the record as the first woman to fly across the
    Atlantic Ocean. She also held the record for altitude,
    reaching a height of 14,000 feet in 1922. And she was the
    first woman to fly solo non-stop across the U.S. She went
    on to become the first person -- man or woman -- to fly
    solo across the Pacific between Honolulu and California.
    But Amelia Earhart wanted to make a truly amazing world
    record. She wanted to be the first person of either gender
    to fly all the way around the world. She planned to retire
    after accomplishing this goal. She wanted to return home
    and spend the rest of her life with her husband and
    children.
    But, fate has a way of changing things in ways that we can
    never understand
    10-17
    The First Lady of the Air (II)
    To the public, Amelia Earhart’s goal seemed unattainable.
    “Fly an airplane around the globe? Impossible!” they
    thought. But Amelia was a determined woman on a
    mission. In her mind, nothing could get in her way.
    She and her assistant, Noonan, set out on her last mission
    on May 21, 1937. If all went well, she would be back in
    California in a few weeks. She would celebrate her 40th
    birthday with her family and friends.
    Her voyage captured the imaginations of people
    everywhere. They followed her every move on that historic
    flight. As Earhart’s journey continued, news of her flight
    made the front page of newspapers around the world.
    People read about her success as she got from California
    to Florida, then along the east coast of South America and
    across the Atlantic to North Africa. People in Singapore
    cheered her on as she steadily worked on making her
    dream a reality. Many people began to believe that this
    female pilot would actually be successful.
    On June 30, 1937, Earhart and Noonan arrived in Lae,
    New Guinea. They had already travelled 35,406
    kilometres, and had only 11,265 kilometres left to go.
    On July 1, they took off from Lae, New Guinea for the last
    and most dangerous part of the flight. Their next
    destination was Howland Island, a tiny island in the Pacific
    Ocean.
    As she approached the island on the morning of July 2,
    after nineteen hours in the air, she sent several radio
    messages asking about the weather. A new weather report
    describing heavy clouds and rain northwest of Howland
    had been issued. Several more transmissions were
    received from her, asking for directions. Then, radio
    contact was lost. She never reached her destination.
    The world waited for days as a massive search took place.
    No sign of her plane or its wreckage was ever found.
    It was as if she had disappeared into thin air. For years
    afterwards, there were reports of Earhart sightings. Today,
    people are still searching for answers to what happened.
    One thing is certain though. Amelia Earhart will always be
    “the first lady” of pioneering pilots.

    An Amazing Plant
    It grows easily in tropical countries. Many people think it’s
    a tree, but it’s really a grass. There are about 1,000
    species of this amazing plant around the world. It has
    been used to build houses, bridges, furniture, pipelines,
    and surgical needles small enough to sew nerves.
    There’s a bridge in China nearly 2,000 years old that is
    made of this material. It can be used in place of steel,
    concrete, and wood, and it has a much lower cost. Many
    people think of it as a product of yesterday, but it could
    easily become a star product of the future. Why?
    Well, for one thing, it’s easy to grow. And it grows very
    quickly. How about three centimetres an hour! That’s fast.
    But wait! In Japan, one species can grow more than one
    metre in one day! The record is one metre in one hour. In
    Brazil, one species can grow up to 45 metres in height.
    Best of all, it can reach full height in about two months. In
    comparison, it takes about 50 years for a tree to mature to
    a height for it to be harvested. Another incredible thing
    about this grass is that when you cut a stem from it, a new
    stem quickly grows back to replace it.
    What is it? You’ve probably already guessed it. It’s
    bamboo!
    In fact, studies have shown that bamboo is tougher than
    the wood from some of the world’s strongest trees. Its
    stems are strong and flexible. It’s lightweight, easy to work
    with and cheap to produce. And, it’s good for the
    environment. The list goes on and on.
    A Frenchman even built and flew an airplane made of
    bamboo! It was fast and easy to handle. He called it the
    “flyboo”.
    One more thing: there is only one animal on this planet
    that eats nothing but bamboo. Do you know what that
    animal is? It’s an endangered and protected species. It
    lives in China. It’s black and white, and very cute.
    You guessed it -- the panda bear!

    The Architect
    My family moved to a new home across the street from a
    grand building -- the Museum of Nature. It’s a national
    monument and a landmark in our city.
    On the day we moved in, my parents’ friend Andrew came
    to visit us. He looked out the window. “You can see the
    museum from here,” he said, pointing to the building. “Do
    you know the story of the ‘castle’?”
    “I know nothing about it,” I said frankly.
    “The museum was originally designed to mirror the central
    tower of the Parliament building.”
    Andrew went on to explain that the task of creating a
    design to showcase the natural treasures of the country
    fell to a well-known chief architect.
    This architect had designed four other stone public
    buildings in the nation’s capital between 1900 and 1914.
    His design called for a massive tower with turrets, a clock
    and a spire. It reflected the classic styles of Europe.
    But, when the construction was half-completed, the
    building started to sink. I couldn’t believe it!
    Andrew said that the cause of the problem was the type of
    soil at the site. A builder needs to assess the soil of a site
    carefully. Some soil expands when it absorbs water. The
    design did not take into account the unstable ground at
    the site.
    As a result, cracks appeared in the foundation. The design
    had to be modified. It posed a great engineering problem,
    and it could not be built as it was originally designed.
    The central tower had to be removed. The building was
    shortened by 80 feet, and the main architectural features
    and strengths of the building were gone.
    “It must have been hard for the architect,” I said.
    “The architect was so frustrated that he jumped off the
    building,” he said.
    I sat there for a long time without saying a word. The story
    of the building and the architect stuck in my mind for many
    days.

    Little Hannah and the Piano
    The piano teacher frowned at Hannah. She had such little
    hands that it seemed that she would not be able to play
    the piano.
    He always asked the students who came to his school
    why they wanted to play. Most said, “My parents want me
    to take lessons.” or, “I don’t know.”
    But when he asked little Hannah, she looked at him and
    smiled. “Bach’s minuet in D Minor,” she said.
    At that moment, the piano teacher knew that she was a
    special little girl. He agreed to take her on as his special
    student.
    His name was Mr. Fillipov, and he spoke with a thick
    Russian accent. In spite of the accent, they were able to
    understand each other. And best of all, they both loved
    Bach.
    Every Tuesday night, Hannah went with her father to Mr.
    Fillipov’s house. She practised for hours.
    She could play very quickly, but she had trouble playing
    the notes that were far apart on the keyboard.
    Finally, the day came for her to play her piece in front of
    an audience. She played it perfectly, until the spot where
    she had to reach with her short little fingers. She couldn’t
    do it, and she made many mistakes. To her, it sounded
    terrible.
    She was so sad that she gave up on the piano. A year
    passed and she didn’t play a single note. Then one day,
    her cat jumped on the keyboard and Hannah moved him
    off.
    She stroked the keys with her fingers, and then tried to
    play the piece that had been so impossible. Suddenly, she
    realized that she could reach the notes. Little Hannah’s
    hands had grown! Not much, but enough.
    She immediately called Mr. Fillipov. “I can reach!” she
    yelled. “I can reach!” From that moment on, there was no
    stopping Hannah. She played and practised every day,
    and now she’s an excellent piano player.
    She’s not the best in the world. She’s not a star. But she
    can play Bach’s minuet in D Minor. And to Hannah, that’s
    fantastic.

    Honesty Is the Best Policy
    (adapted from a European fable)
    Long ago, a man was cutting wood beside a lake. He was
    a good and honest man. He worked hard, and always paid
    what he owed. He believed that honesty was always the
    best policy.
    One day, the man lost his axe in the water. The water was
    deep and he could not get his axe back. He had only one
    axe and needed it to make his living. He sat down and
    began to cry.
    A spirit creature appeared and asked the man what was
    the matter. He listened to the woodcutter and felt sorry for
    the man. The spirit dived into the lake and brought back a
    gold axe. “Is this the axe you lost?” asked the good spirit.
    The woodcutter looked at the solid golden axe, but he was
    honest and said that it wasn’t his. The spirit dived again
    and fetched up a silver one. The man said that the axe
    was not his either. So the spirit went down a third time and
    came up with the woodcutter’s own axe.
    “That’s the right one,” said the woodcutter. “Thank you so
    much for bringing it back to me!” The good spirit was
    delighted with the woodcutter’s honesty. He presented the
    woodcutter with the other two axes as well. “You are an
    honest man,” said the spirit. “For your honesty, I reward
    you. Your life will be good and happy.”
    When the woodcutter rejoined his friends, he told them
    what had happened to him. One of them had an idea. He
    went to the river, deliberately threw his axe into it, and
    then sat down and wept.
    The good spirit appeared again. On hearing the cause of
    his tears, the spirit dived in, brought up a gold axe as
    before, and asked if it was the one that had been lost.
    “Yes! Yes, it is indeed,” the man joyfully exclaimed.
    Shocked by the man’s dishonesty, the good spirit said,
    “Your dishonesty does not trick me. From now on, you will
    have no axe to work with, and you and your family will
    know hunger and poverty.”

    When the Sun or the Moon Disappears
    In the prescientific age, humans understood nature in a
    way that seems strange and foolish to us in our modern
    world. Without the benefit of high-tech instruments, they
    were unable to fully understand what was happening
    around them.
    Ignorance can lead to fear. Nowhere was their fear greater
    than when strange events such as eclipses of the sun or
    the moon occurred.
    Today, we know that the earth and the moon move in a
    regular pattern. Sometimes, the earth’s movement puts it
    between the sun and the moon. When this occurs, the
    earth blocks the sunlight and we see the earth’s shadow
    on the moon. The moon gets dark -- sometimes black,
    sometimes a scary orange colour. This is nothing strange
    at all to our modern minds. It’s simply a lunar (moon)
    eclipse.
    When the moon moves between the earth and the sun, it
    blocks some of the sunlight. As the moon travels in front of
    the sun, the sun seems to disappear. This is a solar (sun)
    eclipse. When the moon, the sun and the earth are
    positioned in a straight line, the sun is completely blocked
    and the earth gets very dark. This is a total solar eclipse,
    and it’s rare.
    It’s easy to see how these strange events frightened our
    ancestors. The word eclipse means “to devour” or “to eat”
    something. Long ago, humans believed that the sun or the
    moon was being eaten. If this were true, it would really be
    a reason to be scared. Imagine how you would feel even
    today, if you thought that the sun was going to disappear
    forever.
    Think of early humans standing outside in the middle of
    the day, as the sun slowly grew dark and then
    disappeared for an hour or more. It would certainly scare
    the daylights out of you. The sun brings warmth, light and
    life!
    Today, science helps us understand strange occurrences.
    When we understand something, we no longer fear it. You
    can easily go on the Internet and find out when the next
    lunar or solar eclipse will happen. You can even go out
    and watch one.

    Clean Living With Basketball
    Americans go wild over basketball. Many Americans
    youngsters grow up dreaming of “shooting hoops” one day
    in the professional leagues. Basketball has always been
    an American game. Today, however, basketball is slowly
    being transformed into a global sport.
    Its inventor, Dr. James Naismith, would be astounded to
    see the current appeal of the game he invented in 1891
    when he was an athletic director at a YMCA training
    school in the U.S.A.
    Naismith grew up in Canada, where he surely played a
    popular children’s school game called “Duck on a Rock”. A
    target, known as the “duck” was situated atop a large rock.
    The object of the game was to throw another rock high
    into the air and make it land in a way that knocked the
    duck off the large rock.
    When Dr. Naismith began working at the men’s training
    school, he remembered this childhood game. He had his
    hands full with tough young teenagers who were in trouble
    with the law. His goal was to educate these troubled
    young men, and to help them turn their lives around in a
    positive way.
    Dr. Naismith wanted a game where strength was not
    enough for victory. He wanted to show the young boys that
    using their brains was a far better way to succeed.
    He nailed a peach basket about four metres above the
    floor at each end of a small gymnasium. A soccer ball was
    used as the first basketball, and a simple set of thirteen
    rules was drawn up.
    From these humble beginnings, the game we now know
    as basketball was born. Over the years, it has changed
    quite a bit. The rule book of thirteen rules has grown by
    leaps and bounds, but the simple elegance of the game
    can still be appreciated.
    By the time of his death in 1939, the game Dr. Naismith
    loved was well on the way to taking its place as a top
    world sport.
    Right up to the end, Dr. Naismith maintained his belief that
    basketball could provide an outlet for troubled kids who
    needed a sport where skill was more important than
    strength -- where the values of clean living ruled.

    The Mountain Climbers
    A man who was climbing a mountain thought he was all
    alone. But suddenly, there was a rumble above him. He
    was hit by a falling rock and then, in an instant, a female
    climber fell from above, landing right on him. They were
    both injured badly. He had broken his leg. He tried to
    stand but could not. The woman had broken her arm and
    could not climb. What were they going to do?
    It was very cold and night was coming. They both knew
    that they would not live through the night if they did not
    make it down the mountain before darkness came.
    They knew they had to come up with something. The
    woman had an idea. “Look,” she said, “I have two good
    legs, and you have two good arms. Together, that makes
    one healthy body.”
    They tied themselves together so that she was on his
    back. Then, he hooked a rope high on a rock and pulled.
    Now, they had to stand up. He pulled with all the strength
    in his arms, and she strained with her legs to lift them
    both.
    Soon, they were upright. He held on to his hope. They
    were going to make it. He supported their weight. Slowly,
    they climbed down, bit by bit.
    Every step was painful. They had to stop every minute or
    so, but they slowly made it down the mountain. He was
    counting on her strong legs and she was counting on the
    strength in his arms to keep them from falling.
    When they made it to the bottom of the mountain hours
    later, they were found by some hikers. They were rushed
    to the hospital. In the end, they were fine.
    They both learned a good lesson that day. A good team is
    not made up of people who can all do the same thing. It
    must have people who can provide many different skills.
    By using their individual strengths, they made it safely
    down the mountain.
    Sometimes in life, we must rely on another person’s
    strengths to make up for our own weaknesses.
    Isn’t it good that we’re all not the same?

    Thanks for Giving
    When I was growing up, we didn’t have a lot of money.
    Although my dad had a good job, there were nine of us
    living in a small house -- my brother and his wife and baby,
    my other brother and my sister, my mom and dad, my
    grandfather, a cousin, and a dog and a cat!
    We ate a lot of food that was not very expensive. We
    never went out for dinner, and if we did anything special, it
    was to go for a picnic.
    My friend Kenny was not like me at all. He was rich. He
    had the fanciest bike and many toys. He had everything
    he wanted, but his parents were not around much. They
    were always working or on business trips.
    It was October before I realized this. One day, when I was
    playing at Kenny’s house I said, “This weekend, we’re
    having a big Thanksgiving dinner with some of our
    neighbours.”
    Then, I asked Kenny, “What are you doing this weekend?
    You’re probably going to a fancy restaurant or flying
    somewhere.”
    A strange look came over his face. “Sure. We’re going to
    have a great time this weekend. My dad is probably going
    to buy a new car.”
    That weekend, we had a huge dinner with more than
    twenty people at our house. We were just starting to eat
    when the doorbell rang. It was Kenny.
    “Hello, Kenny,” my mother said. “Are you coming to dinner
    too?”
    “Well, I... uh...” stammered Kenny.
    My dad jumped up from the table right away and sat
    Kenny down beside me. Soon, my friend was eating and
    having a great time. It turned out that Kenny’s parents
    were both out of town on business trips. He was all alone.
    From then on, Kenny stayed with us many times --
    sometimes for days. My parents never took money from
    Kenny’s parents when they offered.
    As my dad said at the Thanksgiving dinner table, “Let’s all
    be thankful for what we have, and remember that
    Thanksgiving is all about giving.”

    Role Models in Teaching
    Until Brian Green reached high school, his only teachers
    were women. Even as a youngster, he found this strange.
    As he grew older, he knew that he wanted to become a
    teacher for really young children, especially those in
    Grades 1 and 2. Many of his friends asked him, “Why do
    you want to teach those children? Surely you know that it
    is more prestigious to be a high school teacher? Only
    women teach the early grades!”
    But, Brian didn’t pay much attention to these people. He
    recalled his own early education and how there were no
    male teachers for him to look up to. He wanted to change
    this. He wanted to let children know that men and women
    should not be stuck in traditional roles. He wanted to show
    the young students that both males and females could be
    kind and caring teachers.
    As far as Brian was concerned, the most important aspect
    of a good teacher was his or her love for teaching and for
    the students.
    It was difficult in the beginning. He was the first man to
    enter teachers college as a specialist in the early grades.
    Some people even made fun of his decision, but he never
    let go of his dream.
    He graduated a few years ago and found a job in Ottawa
    teaching Grade 1. His students loved him, and he loved
    his students. Last year, Brian Green was honoured as the
    “Most Inspiring Teacher” in his entire province.
    In his acceptance speech, Brian explained, “In the
    beginning, people thought I was crazy. They couldn’t
    understand why I would choose to teach the little ones. I
    hope that by receiving this award, I can be an inspiration
    to other men who want to do something outside of their
    traditional roles. We should always follow our dreams,
    even if it means breaking down some of the traditional
    beliefs about what men and women should be doing.”

    Railway in the Sky
    All aboard! Let’s take a ride on the world’s highest railway.
    Sit back and enjoy the journey.
    Get ready for the trip of a lifetime. You’re about to travel on
    the world’s newest wonder -- the Qinghai-Tibet Railway.
    We’re leaving Qinghai Station. In no time at all, we’ll arrive
    safely in Lhasa, Tibet. The scenery along the way is some
    of the wildest in all of China. Keep your eyes open as we
    race through this beautiful land at speeds of up to 120
    kilometres an hour. You might see a rare Tibetan antelope
    from your window.
    Before we begin our journey, let’s learn about this
    remarkable railway. It’s truly one of the great engineering
    wonders of the 21st century. When it was completed on
    July 1,2006, the Tibet Railway set nine world records,
    including the world’s highest railway at 5,072 metres
    above sea level, the world’s highest tunnel at 4,905
    metres, and the longest tunnel ever built on permafrost.
    And if that’s not enough, the Tibet Railway also has the
    world’s longest railway bridge built over permafrost.
    As we travel high into the Himalayas, the air gets thinner
    and thinner. Soon there will only be 50 to 60 percent of the
    oxygen most of us are used to breathing. But don’t be
    afraid. Each rail car has two separate oxygen systems.
    One system spreads oxygen throughout the train at all
    times. In addition, each passenger has access to a
    personal oxygen mask just like those used in high altitude
    jets.
    Here are a few more things to think about as our train
    leaves the station. The designers overcame three major
    challenges when building this great railway. First, the high
    altitude made construction difficult due to lack of oxygen.
    Second, much of the railway runs across permafrost, a
    type of ground that is constantly changing as the weather
    warms and cools. It’s like building something on a sponge
    – not an easy task! Finally, the railway goes through some
    of the most sensitive ecology in China. Great care was
    necessary to ensure the smallest possible effect on
    nature.
    All three challenges were met, making our voyage
    possible. All aboard! The train to Tibet is leaving in fifteen
    minutes.

    My Friend Juan
    I first met Juan one day when I was walking home from
    school. Suddenly, I heard the sound of a dog growling. I
    turned the corner, and there was Juan. He was hanging
    from a tree branch, and the dog was jumping up and trying
    to bite him.
    I yelled at the dog and scared it away. Then, I helped Juan
    out of the tree. He was very thankful. He was shaking and
    had been bitten. My mother and I took him to a doctor who
    lived next door. He gave Juan a few stitches on his back.
    We could see that he was sick. He was very thin and he
    lived on the street in a poor part of our city.
    My mother really didn’t like Juan very much. Even though
    she felt sorry for him, she thought that he was very lazy
    and all he did was sleep. He ate a lot and he kept late
    hours. The one nice thing she would say about him was
    that he had big, beautiful eyes. But she felt he was noisy
    and was always asking for more food.
    Juan stared out the window all day. He was always
    nervous and jumped at the smallest things. But he
    became a great friend to me. I told him things that I would
    tell no one else in the world. If I had a bad day, Juan would
    listen to me and he would always play with me.
    One day, my mother got sick and Juan stayed with her all
    day. That was when she really got to like him. You see,
    she hated mice and Juan took it on as his job to catch all
    the mice in the house.
    Of course, he also ate them. That may seem a little
    strange, but perhaps I forgot to mention that although
    Juan was a boy, he was also something else -- a cat!

    The Eagle and the Mouse
    The young eagle was the only one in his family that had
    not flown. Every day, he looked down at the valley far
    below and thought, “I will never be able to fly.”
    His mother was willing to let him stay in the nest, but his
    father felt that it was time for the young bird to leave.
    But it seemed that the young eagle was not interested in
    being an eagle. In fact, although his kind loved to eat
    small mice and rabbits, this young eagle had a small
    mouse who was his friend. Every day, they would play in
    the secret caves in the high cliffs where they lived.
    One day, as they played and jumped, they realized they
    were being watched. They turned around, and it was the
    eagle’s father staring at them, his eagle eyes glaring with
    anger.
    “You are the reason why my son is a mouse, not an
    eagle!” he said, angrily.
    He jumped towards the mouse, his sharp claws ready to
    catch him. But the mouse leaped out of the little cave.
    Suddenly, they heard a scream. The mouse had jumped
    too far and fallen over the cliff to his certain death.
    The little eagle knew what he had to do. He leapt into the
    air and out over the cliff. He began to fall, thousands of
    metres to the valley below. His eagle eyes saw his little
    friend. He did what he saw his father do many times. He
    straightened his body like a bullet and he started to go
    faster.
    The ground was rushing towards him, but he did not stop.
    With only a few feet to go, he grabbed the mouse by the
    tail and landed safely. The father landed a second later
    and said to the little mouse, “Your friendship was the
    reason my son learned to fly. You can live by our nest and
    never fear any bird again.”
    Then, the mouse climbed onto the young eagle’s back and
    off they went to explore the world together.
    Friends forever -- the eagle and the mouse.

    How Bees Make Honey
    Some people say honey is a health food. Put it on a cut
    and it will help the cut heal quickly. Eat it, and it will boost
    your natural ability to fight off infections.
    The ancient Egyptian kings put honey inside their tombs to
    take along to the afterlife. That was thousands of years
    ago. Today, when the tombs are opened, the honey is
    good to eat. It has nutritional value too. Honey is a very
    special food. Bees eat it, and so do humans.
    But what is honey? Where does it come from? How is it
    made? You probably know that bees make honey. Not all
    bees though. Only one special kind of bee -- the honeybee
    -- makes honey. Here’s how they do it.
    Flowers have a special relationship with bees. They make
    a sweet liquid called “nectar”. It’s 80 percent water.
    Special bees collect this nectar to make honey. These
    special bees have long tongues. They use their tongues to
    suck the sweet liquid from the flowers.
    The bees that collect nectar have two stomachs. One
    stomach is used only for storing the nectar. When this
    stomach is full of nectar, it weighs almost as much as the
    bee.
    It can take up to one thousand flowers to fill the nectar
    stomach of a collecting bee. Imagine that! It’s a lot of
    flowers to visit.
    At the hive where the bees live, another kind of bee, a
    worker bee puts its tongue inside the nectar bee and
    sucks the sweet water from its nectar stomach. The
    worker bee chews on the nectar for an hour. It then
    spreads the nectar in the hive. Using its wings as a fan,
    the bee causes the water to evaporate from the nectar. It
    then becomes the thick, sweet syrup that we call honey.
    Honey provides food for all the bees in the hive. In a year,
    a colony of bees eats about 150 pounds of honey. That’s a
    lot of honey to make!
    Some humans keep bees, take the honey from the hive
    and sell it. That’s how we get honey. You might say that
    bees, flowers and people work together to make one of
    nature’s special foods.

    A Mother’s Love
    The little girl went to school each day feeling frightened.
    She had grown used to it, but it still hurt each time her
    classmates teased.
    When she was younger, she used to hide when the insults
    began. But as she grew older, she no longer hid in shame.
    Still, it hurt. The teasing turned her into a girl who kept to
    herself. She had no friends, although friends were what
    she longed for most.
    “Your mother is so ugly,” the kids would shout. “Your
    mother’s face is like a monster’s face,” they said. “Sheena
    has a monster for a mother!”
    Sometimes, Sheena wanted to pretend that her mother
    was not her mother. She wanted to deny her mother, to tell
    the others that she was in fact not her mother at all. When
    this happened, she was filled with guilt and shame, for her
    mother was the kindest and most generous of all the
    mothers in the world.
    Sheena’s mother did in fact have a frightful face. It was
    scarred and deformed, unpleasant and disgusting – long
    purple scars and a disfigured nose. In a word: horrible.
    One day, when Sheena came home crying, her
    grandmother took her aside. “Why are you crying?” asked
    her grandmother. Sheena explained how difficult it was to
    withstand the teasing from her classmates. She told her
    how lonely she felt each day at school.
    Her grandmother said, “It’s time to tell you the story of how
    your mother came to have such a face. When you were
    just a baby, you were sleeping in your bed and your
    mother was across the street talking with a neighbour.
    Suddenly, she noticed smoke coming from your house.
    Everyone rushed to the door, but it was too dangerous to
    go inside. Your mother did not think twice. She ran into the
    fire, not thinking for an instant of herself, only of you, her
    dear child. She brought you out safely, but her whole body
    was burned from top to bottom, especially her face. That’s
    how she came to have the ugly scars.”
    Sheena was never again embarrassed of her mother.
    From that day on, she walked with her head high, knowing
    that she, above all the other children, had a mother who
    loved her completely.
