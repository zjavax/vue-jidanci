  <div class="myclass">

    My uncle sends me a picture. It’s a picture of a blue sky
    and white clouds.
    “I am so happy to see the blue sky!” says my uncle.
    I wonder why. “Isn’t the sky always blue?”
    “No,” he says. “The sky in my city is often grey because
    there are too many cars.”
    That’s why he is so excited!
    “White clouds and a blue sky. It’s beautiful!”

    where people don’t have food to eat, and they go hungry.”

    good!”
    “You don’t like fruit?”

    Basketball ls Fun
    My uncle gave me a basketball for my birthday.
    Uncle showed me how to bounce the ball. At first, I could
    only bounce the ball a few times.
    With practice, I could bounce the ball up to ten, eleven,
    twelve… twenty… thirty… and one hundred times! I was
    so excited.
    I wish I could put the ball in the net!
    “I did it!”

    A Picture for Dad
    I painted a picture of my dad for his birthday.
    It was the first time I drew a picture of him.
    At the party, I was scared to give it to him. Why? Because
    it wasn’t very good.
    But when my dad saw it, he said that he liked it.
    He put it right up on the wall and said, “It looks just like
    me!”
    “It looks just like me!”

    “Yes, milk can come from cows. But around the world,
    people also drink milk from sheep, horses, and camels,”
    says the teacher.
    Wow! Joey learns something new.
    “Wow! He can drink a lot of milk!”

    Christmas was very different this year. On Christmas Day,
    there was no snow or ice. It was a windy day.
    The wind was so strong, I could not even walk on the
    street. I had to run!
    The strong wind pushed me all the way home. I think the
    wind pushed Santa Claus home too.

    The First Word
    I wonder what the first word was. Who spoke the first
    word? How long ago?
    Was it “hello”? Or was it “goodbye”?

    Day or Night
    Up in the sky is the red, hot sun. The sun gives us light
    and keeps us warm.
    At night, we cannot see the sun, but the sun is still there.
    Why can’t we see the sun at night? The Earth moves
    around the sun. At night, the sun is on the other side of
    the Earth.
    For example, when it is dark in Canada, the sun is shining
    in China.
    “I’m the sun!”

    Round and Round
    One day in my class, our teacher said, “Cars, buses,
    bicycles, trains, and even planes are all the same in one
    way. Does anyone know how?”

    “That’s it!” I put up my hand. “They all have wheels.”
    The teacher said, “Very good! Now please put your apple
    away.”
    “Very good!”
