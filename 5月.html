    At the Market
    When my dad was a young man, he spent some time in
    northern Africa. “You learn a lot about the world when you
    get out and see it,” my father always says.
    While in Africa, my dad woke up early one morning and
    decided to take a walk. He slowly walked through the
    market, admiring the goods for sale in the shops.
    Dad entered a small shop. He saw a small brass butterfly
    and asked the man, “How much for this?” The man told
    him the price, but Dad was not interested in buying it. He
    just wanted to know how much it cost.
    Dad left and continued his walk through the town. All of a
    sudden, he saw the man from the market. “Hey Mister,”
    said the man, “I would REALLY like to sell this toy butterfly
    to you. Please! If the price is too high, what price would
    you pay for it?”
    But Dad was not interested. He was polite, but he told the
    man that he did not want to buy it. “Please,” cried the man.
    “I will give it to you for only a few pennies.” But my father
    politely refused again and left. Soon he was on another
    street and to his surprise, the man from the market was
    there too.
    “Sir, I do not want to bother you, but please purchase this
    toy from me.” Three more times, as he walked through the
    village, Dad encountered the man from the market. Each
    time, the man begged my father to buy the toy. Each time,
    my dad said no, and went on his way.
    Finally, the man said, “You do not know the customs of my
    country. It is the custom that I must make a sale to the first
    person to enter my shop on a Friday morning. You were
    the first to come to my shop today, so I must sell this toy to
    you. Please, will you not help me out? It will mean bad
    luck for me if you do not buy it.”
    My father realized how important this was. He decided to
    purchase the toy. “How much for it?” he asked. “One
    penny,” said the old man eagerly. My father gladly gave
    the man two dollars, for he had learned something of the
    country’s culture that day.

    The Old Janitor
    A young man named Lenny started working at a factory.
    He had just graduated from school and he was very proud
    of his job.
    There was a problem though. Lenny felt that his job was
    more important than the jobs of other factory workers. He
    was rude to the janitors, who he considered below him in
    status.
    He was especially hard on one old janitor. The old man
    didn’t seem to do very much, and as far as Lenny was
    concerned, he did not contribute much to the factory.
    Late one night, when Lenny was still at work, he found the
    old janitor sleeping in a corner. He got mad and called him
    lazy and useless. The old man apologized and worked
    very hard the rest of the night.
    The next day, there was a big visit from the president of
    the company, a rich and powerful man. When the
    president arrived at the factory, everyone was a little
    nervous. The president talked to people and asked them
    about their work.
    Lenny was standing right beside the old janitor. What
    happened next shocked Lenny. The president walked right
    up to the old janitor and put his arm around him.
    He said, “Mr. Jensen is my oldest and most valued
    employee. When I first started this company 30 years ago,
    he worked as my janitor. Back then, I could hardly afford to
    pay him, so I gave him shares in the company. He doesn’t
    need to work, but he likes to be here and we’re glad to
    have him. Has everyone been treating you right?” the
    president asked. Lenny was sweating because he knew
    that the old janitor could have him fired in a second.
    The old janitor looked at Lenny and said, “Everyone has
    been very nice, even when I am a little slow.” Everyone
    laughed.
    The president then said, “That’s good because every job
    in this factory is just as important as the rest.” The
    president was a wise man, and that day, Lenny learned a
    lesson that he would never forget: treat all people with
    respect.

    A Hidden Talent
    There is a young boy in my class who has a hard time
    saying certain words. His name is Bill, and sometimes kids
    make fun of him. Sometimes, he’ll say the same word
    twice or he’ll stutter. He’s very shy and doesn’t say much.
    One day, there was a sign on the wall asking people to try
    out for the school play.
    We looked and saw Bill’s name on the list. We wondered
    how he could possibly be in a play with his speech
    problem.
    The rehearsals went on for weeks, and finally the big night
    arrived. The curtain opened and the show began. Bill got
    on stage and spoke his first lines. He stuttered terribly.
    Some people thought he was joking, but he wasn’t.
    Then, the most amazing thing happened. When the music
    started, he tapped his foot and began to sing. It came out
    perfectly. He had a beautiful voice and not a single stutter.
    He sang more songs than anyone and he danced
    perfectly. Bill was a different person when he sang.
    The next day at school, everyone congratulated Bill. He
    explained to us that it’s common for people who stutter to
    be able to sing perfectly well. Science doesn’t know why,
    but it’s a fact.
    We learned more than just a scientific fact that day. We
    learned that everyone has things they can’t do, and things
    they can do. We all have to be understanding of that. As
    for Bill, he still stutters. But sometimes when he has a hard
    time giving an answer in class, he just stops and sings the
    answer. That’s always the highlight of the class.
    Sometimes we all sing along too! It makes us happy to
    see our friend having such a good time in spite of his
    speech problem.

    Her Best Friend
    When my sister Becky was young, she was bitten by a
    dog. It was really frightening. From that day on, she didn’t
    like dogs. But all of that changed when my uncle had to go
    away for a week.
    My uncle left his dog with us to take care of. The dog’s
    name was Rex, and he was huge. Poor Rex would follow
    my sister around, which, of course, she hated because of
    her fear of dogs.
    One day, to get away from Rex, my sister tied him to a
    chair on the porch and went for a walk in the forest. She
    looked back and saw him pulling at his rope, but he stayed
    where she had tied him.
    While walking in the forest, Becky suddenly heard a deep,
    scary growl. She turned and saw a pack of wolves eating
    a deer that had just been killed. Normally, wolves would
    not bother a human, but when they are eating, they can be
    very dangerous, especially for a child.
    Slowly, the wolves began to move towards Becky, making
    a circle around her and trapping her in the middle. She
    was close to a tree, and in desperation, she grabbed a
    lower branch and tried to climb up the tree to get away.
    One of the wolves grabbed her leg. Somehow, she was
    able to pull herself up, but her ankle was badly injured.
    She screamed for help, but no one was around. The
    wolves circled below the tree, jumping and howling. She
    thought she was going to faint. Suddenly, Rex appeared.
    There he was, running through the forest, dragging the
    chair to which she had tied him earlier. It was not easy for
    Rex, but he made his way to where Becky was trapped in
    the tree. He attacked the wolves, and within seconds, they
    ran off.
    When Becky and Rex got home, everyone was shocked
    and happy that Rex had saved my sister. He licked her
    face as the doctor treated her foot.
    Now, as you can guess, Rex is my sister’s favourite friend
    in the world. The doctor told her, “It just proves that a dog
    is a man’s best friend.” My sister smiled and added, “And
    a girl’s best friend too.”

    The Icebox (I)
    Our science teacher always enjoys giving out peculiar and
    challenging assignments to our Grade 10 science class.
    Unlike other teachers who hand out page upon page of
    textbook questions, Mr. Hussey seems to prefer having
    the students learn science through a more hands-on, do-
    it-yourself approach.
    “Today,” said Mr. Hussey, “everyone will be making an
    icebox!” As we sat in awe, trying to imagine what kind of
    device he was referring to, Mr. Hussey handed out the
    project specifications. In groups of two, we would design a
    storage device that was capable of keeping its contents at
    a constant temperature for a certain period of time,
    regardless of the outside temperature.
    Because the teacher would not provide any supplies, we
    could use any material we wanted and build the box any
    way we liked. The evaluation would be done in class in a
    week, when everyone would bring their work to class for a
    competition. The competition was quite straightforward:
    every contestant would receive a cube of ice. The team
    that had the biggest piece left the next day would win!
    As always, I partnered with my faithful sidekick, Vlad.
    That afternoon we went straight to the library. After an
    intense discussion, we agreed on the basic idea of having
    the ice cube inside a box, which would be put inside
    another bigger box. Between the two boxes would be the
    heat insulator.
    I knew that a vacuum layer was the best insulator. And
    Vlad insisted that Styrofoam itself would make a good
    insulating shell too. But soon, we realized that it was
    impossible to make a vacuum inside blocks of Styrofoam,
    even with a pump, valves and gauges.
    After slight modifications, our first design was made: a
    small Styrofoam box inside a large Styrofoam box and, of
    course, air between the two.
    Building the device was much harder than anticipated.
    Originally expecting that it would be an easy task, I
    couldn’t believe how hard it could be to cut a straight line
    through a piece of Styrofoam! Regardless of the tools I
    used -- scissors, a knife or a ruler -- and regardless of how
    straight the pieces of Styrofoam looked, there were always
    gaps when I put them together.
    5-6
    The Icebox (II)
    Our icebox was finally sitting on the table waiting for the
    glue to dry, with a slanted bottom and cracks between
    every ridge. At that moment, Vlad and I sincerely thanked
    the teacher for not evaluating the cool box on its
    appearance.
    The first test of the icebox was extremely disappointing.
    Since this was our first experiment, we both wanted good
    results to boost our confidence. Before I went to bed that
    night, I carefully picked out a huge block of ice from our
    refrigerator and placed it inside the icebox. When I woke
    up unusually early the next morning and looked into the
    icebox, there wasn’t even a speck of ice left. Even the
    melted water had leaked through the cracked edges!
    “What do you think?” I asked Vlad.
    “Let’s start again,” he said, shaking his head.
    Reflecting on this failure, we were determined to find a
    better insulating material than air. After stuffing the inside
    of the big box with fibreglass, we tried the same
    experiment again.
    “How did we do this time?” asked Vlad over the phone.
    “Seventy percent!” I exclaimed.
    “Nice!”
    The day of the competition came very fast. We all brought
    our masterpieces into the classroom. Virtually every team
    had a different design -- from boxes made of different
    materials to boxes that operated in different ways. One
    fellow even attached a motor to his icebox and turned it
    into a refrigerator. Putting all the iceboxes side by side on
    the table, we left for home, hoping that we would win.
    The next day, everybody rushed towards these works of
    art, hoping that there would still be morsels of ice left.
    Some kids searched and searched, and were even about
    to tear their iceboxes apart, but couldn’t find anything.
    Luckily, it turned out that we didn’t do too badly. Having
    almost 60 percent of the ice cube still remaining, we had
    an above average result!
    The winner of the competition, however, was the guy who
    made a motorized refrigerator. When we opened his
    icebox, he had a piece of ice that was 140 percent the
    size of the original! His innovative design was definitely a
    cut above the rest.

    Ideas Are Easy
    (adapted from Aesop’s fables)
    The cat hunts the mouse. The mouse tries to avoid being
    caught. It has always been this way.
    It is not easy being a mouse in such circumstances. And
    so, one day, the mice held a community meeting. The
    topic of discussion was what to do about the cat.
    “The cat is our enemy,” exclaimed one young mouse. “We
    must do something to protect ourselves!” cried the other
    mice. “We cannot live this way, for it is too dangerous to
    go out during the day. Even at night, the cat lurks in the
    shadows waiting to pounce on one of us as we go about
    our business.”
    There was general agreement that a solution must be
    found to this serious problem. At once, a young mouse
    jumped to his feet. “I have an idea,” said the young
    mouse, who was considered a future leader. “As we know,
    our problem is the way the cat sneaks up silently on us
    when we least expect him. My proposal is simple and
    foolproof.”
    The other mice nodded in anticipation, happy to see
    wisdom in such a young future leader. “The solution is to
    hang a bell around the cat’s neck. When he approaches,
    the bell will ring, and we will be warned in time to escape.”
    His fellow mice applauded loudly and thought, “Now this is
    a smart mouse. Surely he will be our leader one day.”
    Just then, a wise old mouse stood up to address the other
    mice. “That is a good idea,” said the old mouse. “Now may
    I ask, who will volunteer to hang the bell around the cat’s
    neck?”
    There was general silence among the mice then. No one
    stood up to volunteer for such a dangerous job. The old
    mouse said, “It is easy to suggest a solution -- especially
    when carrying it out is impossible.”

    Monsters
    When my brother was young, he was afraid of monsters.
    He didn’t know what a monster was like, or even what a
    monster really was. Still, he was scared to death of
    monsters! All he knew was that a monster was powerful,
    scary and maybe evil. If you told him that a monster was
    coming, he would run away to seek protection with our
    parents.
    One day, he went with Mom to the university where she
    teaches. There, he ran into an old professor named Jerry.
    When he saw my little brother come in, Jerry asked, “Little
    Bobby, are you afraid of monsters?”
    “No, I’m not!” my brother said. But he secretly still had his
    fear of monsters.
    “Listen, I have a BIG new monster in this building. It’s
    hiding in the basement and peeking at you,” teased Jerry.
    “You don’t have a monster!” said my brother. “I’m not lying
    to you. My monster is called X-ray. His powerful eyes can
    see through your skin, right to your bones!” This really
    frightened my brother, and he ran away to find Mom.
    When Mom learned that Jerry was using X-ray monsters
    to scare my brother, she laughed.
    “Don’t be silly. There is no such thing as monsters,” she
    said. “Let me explain. An X-ray is like a light ray with a
    shorter wavelength. It’s a kind of electromagnetic wave.
    It’s just radiation emitted from some kind of material. It’s
    similar to the waves that allow us to see the images on the
    television and to listen to the radio. You’ll learn about it
    when you grow up. And when you learn about and
    understand X-rays, you will not fear them anymore.”
    Seeing Bobby’s eyes open wide as he listened carefully,
    she continued, “X-rays are not the most powerful
    radiation. There are other kinds of rays, such as gamma-
    rays, which are much stronger.”
    On learning all of this, my brother became excited. He
    spent the rest of the day planning how to scare Jerry with
    his newly discovered monster -- GAMMA RAY.

    Birthdays Around the World
    My good friend Carlos invited me to his birthday party. He
    moved to Canada from Mexico when he was a baby, but
    his parents tried to maintain some of the Mexican
    traditions.
    At his party, I saw my first pinata. It was made out of paper
    and shaped like an animal. Carlos’s parents had filled it
    with candies. They hung it from the ceiling. Carlos was
    blindfolded so he could not see. He hit the pinata with a
    stick until it broke. All the candies fell on the floor, and we
    had a great time gathering and eating candies. Everyone
    shared. It was really fun!
    Carlos’s birthday party got me thinking about how kids in
    other places celebrate birthdays.
    Did you know that in Vietnam, everyone’s birthday is on
    the same day? Kids do not celebrate on the actual day
    they were born. Instead, on New Year’s Day, all the kids
    celebrate their birthdays. Parents give kids red envelopes
    with lucky money in them. What a great way to celebrate
    birthdays!
    In South Africa, kids do not celebrate every birthday.
    However, on their 21st birthday, their parents make a key.
    It can be made of paper, wood, or even gold or silver.
    Parents give their child this key. It is a sign from the
    parents that the child can now “unlock the door to their
    future life”. Cool, don’t you think?
    In Scotland, children get two things on their birthdays.
    They get one dollar for each year. And they also get one
    soft slap on their bottoms for each year. Oh yes... and they
    get one extra slap for good luck.
    In Nepal, children get a special mark on their faces.
    Rice and colouring are mixed and painted on the child’s
    forehead for good luck. In Japan, children get a brand new
    set of clothes on their birthdays. While in Italy, adults pull
    children’s ears -- one pull for each year. In Denmark, a flag
    flies outside the window of a house where a child is having
    a birthday. When the child is asleep, adults put presents
    all around the child’s bed.
    There are many ways to celebrate birthdays. How do you
    celebrate birthdays in your country?

    One Mother’s Day Morning
    It was Mother’s Day. When I woke up that morning, I knew
    something was not quite right in the house. Usually, I am
    the first to get up. But this morning, I could hear someone
    else up and rummaging around in the kitchen. I heard the
    sound of pots and pans clinking, the refrigerator door
    opening and closing, and water running. Things sounded
    quite busy.
    I called to see what was going on. My little boy quickly
    answered. “Don’t get up, Mom!” he shouted as he came
    running to my bedroom door. “I’m making something
    special for you this Mother’s Day. I’m making a special
    breakfast for you, and I want to serve it to you in bed.”
    I was surprised because my son had never cooked
    breakfast before. I wondered if I should get up and insist
    that I help him. Better sense ruled, however, and I decided
    to lie back and wait to see what my little angel would cook
    for me. It was all I could do to stay in bed. I smelled toast
    burning in the toaster, and I heard bacon frying too quickly
    in the pan. But I resisted the temptation to get up and help
    my little boy. He sure was making a lot of noise cooking up
    a storm in the kitchen!
    In a few minutes, I heard a knock at the bedroom door.
    My little 7-year-old son came in carrying a tray with a
    toasted bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich, arranged on
    the centre of a plate and a glass of milk spilling over. The
    toast was burnt to a crisp and the bacon hard and dry.
    This was his first attempt at cooking. I could feel the tears
    of joy coming to my eyes as the little guy proudly put the
    tray of food on my bed and leaned over to give me a kiss.
    “Happy Mother’s Day!” he said.
    I ate the meal happily, although it was difficult to make the
    dry, burnt toast go down my throat. Yes, that was many
    years ago.
    Now, when my son calls to wish me well on Mother’s Day,
    we recall that morning. We always laugh about it. It has
    become a special story that we share.

    Mosquito Patrol
    We were going to spend a month at a beautiful cottage. It
    was not a fancy place, but it was right on a lake. One thing
    we all looked forward to was campfires at night.
    The first day passed and when evening came, we sat
    around our first campfire. We were all enjoying ourselves,
    when someone cried, “Ouch! I just got bit by a mosquito.”
    As the darkness increased, so did the number of
    mosquitoes.
    There were only a few at first, but it soon seemed like
    there were hundreds of them. Bug spray only worked for a
    while, and the strong smell of it made my little sister feel
    sick. Things were so bad that we gave up trying to have
    campfires at night. It just wasn’t any fun.
    Through the trees, we could see a cottage about 50
    metres away. One day, a group of people arrived there.
    And that night, they had a campfire. We watched as they
    sat around the fire for hours and never seemed to be
    bothered by mosquitoes. How did they do it? We were
    curious.
    The next day, we went over and asked them. The man
    pointed to a small flat box nailed to a tree beside the
    campfire. “That’s our mosquito patrol,” he said. My dad
    was very interested. “Really, how does it work?” he asked.
    “Does it use radio signals?”
    “No!” laughed the man. “It uses bats.”
    My mother looked horrified.
    “Come on over tonight, and we’ll show you,” he said.
    That night, it was amazing to watch. As it got dark, the
    mosquitoes started to buzz around. But we soon began to
    hear squeaks. It was as though the mother bat had called,
    “Feeding time!” All of a sudden, you could see little black
    shapes moving swiftly in the air, like little mice with wings.
    They swooped with amazing precision and feasted on the
    mosquitoes. They never bothered us. And those five bats
    kept us mosquito-free all night!
    “Forget bug spray!” our neighbour said. “Mother Nature
    has the best answer.” And of course, he was right.

    Stick Together for Strength
    (adapted from Aesop’s fables)
    A long time ago, a father was old and sick. He did not
    have much time to live, and he wanted to give his sons a
    good lesson before he died.
    Recently, he noticed that his sons were fighting among
    themselves and seemed unable to agree on anything. The
    old man feared what would happen after his death. He
    was afraid that his sons would begin to argue. “They will
    disagree about everything,” he thought. “Soon they will be
    enemies, each going his own direction.”
    He called his sons together in his room. “Bring me a
    bundle of sticks,” he commanded his servant. Soon
    enough, a thick bundle of sticks arrived, tied tightly
    together with a strong cord. One by one, he gave the
    bundle to each son, and asked him to break the bundle.
    One son after another pulled and twisted with all of his
    strength, but the sticks would not break.
    The old man smiled and ordered his servant to untie the
    bundle of sticks. He handed one stick to each son and
    said, “Now break the stick.”
    Of course, the single stick snapped easily and was broken
    in two. The old father looked at his sons. “Do you
    understand this lesson?” he asked.
    Each son, being intelligent, understood the meaning
    immediately. Alone, it is easy for one of them to be
    harmed. But together, they are strong and cannot be
    harmed even by great forces.
    That’s the meaning of sticking together. In unity, there is
    great strength.

    What Is It?
    Nearly everyone in the world eats some of it every day. In
    fact, you cannot live without it. It’s a mineral. It’s usually
    white and it has a strong taste. Every cell in your body
    contains it. Tears and sweat have it too.
    It was once used by the Romans to pay their soldiers. In
    parts of Africa, it is used instead of money to pay for
    things. The oceans are filled with it. You can get it from the
    earth as well. Pour it on food, and you can keep the food
    from going bad for a very long time.
    What is it? It’s salt, of course. Since the beginning of time,
    it has been an important part of people’s lives. Wars have
    been fought over it. Kings have come to power by
    controlling access to it. The French Revolution was
    started, in part, because the king put a large tax on salt.
    The peasants did not like this and rose to fight the king.
    Today, salt is used in making nearly 15,000 products. The
    jeans you wear have salt in them. In cold countries that
    are covered with snow and ice in the winter, people
    spread salt on the roads to melt the ice. Driving would be
    much more dangerous if not for salt.
    Where does salt come from? It is mined from shallow
    holes in the earth. In some places, it sits on top of the
    earth, and people simply cut and carry it away. But the
    oceans are where most of the salt lies. Ocean water is
    salty and not good to drink. The sun evaporates seawater,
    leaving only salt.
    Many expressions in English refer to salt. Sometimes, it is
    said that a worker is “worth his salt”. This means that the
    person works very hard and is valuable. Remember that
    the Romans paid soldiers in salt. This is probably where
    the expression comes from.

    Sandbag Day
    One day, our little town was in trouble. We lived in a rocky
    area, but there was a stream that ran through our town. It
    hardly ever rained here, but far away in the mountains
    where the stream came from, it had rained like never
    before.
    Our little stream turned into a river, and it was quickly
    rising. We would soon be under water if we didn’t act fast.
    Unfortunately, our entire town had only ten sandbags to
    hold back the rising water! We needed hundreds of
    sandbags to protect our town from a flood.
    With only a day before the river would spill over its banks,
    we knew that we had to make our own sandbags. Where
    would we get the bags and sand? There was no sand in
    our town. It was all rock.
    “We could make the sandbags, but we don’t have any
    sand!” one person said.
    “Then we’ll all just have to leave town and find somewhere
    safe to stay. We’ll have to wait and see what happens.”
    The people agreed. Everyone started packing their things
    and prepared to leave.
    Many of us had just started to drive away, when an old
    man stood in the middle of the road to stop us. “Where are
    you all going?” he asked. We explained that we were
    going to safety, and that he should leave too. He laughed
    and said, “If it’s sand you want, there’s tons of it up near
    my place.” He lived about a mile away, up in some hills.
    Within minutes, we were all heading to his place. We
    formed a line of people and started to fill the sandbags.
    Some of us filled the bags while some of us loaded the
    trucks. Others piled the bags along the edges of the river.
    In ten hours, we had made more than 300 sandbags.
    The river flooded that night and many houses were
    damaged, but the town was not lost. The old man was a
    hero. Every year since then, we celebrate “Sandbag Day”,
    and he is the head of the party.

    Why?
    My name is Al, and I have a story I’d like to tell. When I
    was a young boy, I didn’t fit in with the other kids. I felt
    different. Some kids made fun of me. Maybe this sounds
    like someone you know.
    Maybe this sounds like you.
    I used to have a hard time at school. Things that were
    easy for some kids were difficult for me. I couldn’t pay
    attention. My mind wandered, and I didn’t get good marks.
    In fact, some teachers thought I might never graduate.
    While other kids lived for gym class, I hated it. I didn’t see
    the point in the games the kids played.
    Then one day, I saw something that really changed my
    life. I was looking at a compass, and thought, “Why does
    that little needle always know where north is?” It may
    seem silly now, but at the time, it made me take a second
    look at this thing I had seen many times before. I asked
    the simple question, “Why?”
    I started to read about it and in doing so, I found that
    physics was really interesting to me.
    I started borrowing books from school and learning the
    math behind common things of everyday life.
    I started catching up to my classmates. Soon, I was
    beyond them. By the end of high school, I was far ahead
    of my teachers.
    I got a job at an office. In my spare time, I worked on my
    ideas. I sent these ideas to a university. The university told
    me that I had come up with something very important.
    Since then, my ideas have been used to look at the world
    differently. Some say that they changed the way we look
    at the universe.
    It all started that day when I looked at something I had
    seen many times and asked the question, “Why?”
    You may know me. My name is Al... Albert Einstein.

    Whales: Swimming Mammals
    My family is going on an exciting summer vacation. We’re
    going to see the whales in the St. Lawrence River in
    Canada.
    Whales are mysterious animals. We don’t really know a lot
    about them, but many humans feel a special connection
    with them. It’s probably because whales, like humans, are
    mammals. Whales are warm-blooded. Their young are
    born alive, and they feed their babies milk. They live in
    large social groups, and some families stay together for a
    lifetime.
    Scientists believe that whales once lived on land, like
    other mammals. However, millions of years ago, their
    bodies began to change. Their back legs disappeared,
    and their front legs changed into flippers. Slowly, they
    became ocean dwellers. But they are not fish. They can
    stay underwater a long time, but they must come to the
    surface of the water to breathe.
    In many ways, whales organize their lives in the same way
    humans do. They have special languages for
    communication.
    That’s right -- whales talk to each other! Scientists are
    trying to understand these languages. Some whales can
    send sounds hundreds of kilometres through the ocean.
    There are two types of whales: those with teeth and those
    without teeth. The whales without teeth are called baleen
    whales.
    Some of the whales that have teeth get really big. For
    example, the blue whale is the largest animal ever to live
    on earth. It can grow up to 35 metres in length.
    Whales were once plentiful. But until recently, humans
    over-hunted some kinds of whales. Hundreds of years
    ago, great whaling ships set sail from Europe and Japan
    to travel the world hunting whales. Do you know why?
    Well, most whales live in cold oceans. They need a lot of
    body fat to stay warm. Long ago, whale fat or “blubber”
    made good oil for powering lamps.
    I’m really excited about this trip to see the beluga whales
    in Canada. I always like to have a few facts in mind before
    I go to explore something new.
    And I’m sure I’ll learn a whole lot more when I’m in the
    boat and up close.

    My Mother, the Plumber
    Most of my friends have mothers who do the usual things.
    Some of them are housewives, but most have regular
    jobs. They work in offices, make things in factories or work
    as doctors, lawyers or scientists.
    But my mom has always been a little different. One day,
    she came home from work and announced to the family
    that she and her best friend Tammy were going to become
    plumbers.
    They took courses at an adult school. After about a year,
    they were ready to begin working as plumbers’ helpers.
    The problem was that no one would hire them. All the
    other plumbers were men, and people did not believe that
    women could be just as good as men. Even the
    neighbours would not hire them.
    One day, a plumbing truck pulled up to Mrs. Reed’s house.
    She is weak, old and in a wheelchair.
    My mother and Tammy watched as the man went in and
    out of the house, bringing tools and pipes. The truck drove
    away after a couple of hours.
    Later that day, my little brother came home and asked,
    “Mom, why is there water coming out of Mrs. Reed’s
    house?” Tammy and my mom sprang into action. They
    grabbed their belts and tools, and headed to Mrs. Reed’s
    house.
    They ran down the street and knocked on the door. No
    answer. In desperation, they smashed a window and
    climbed in. There was Mrs. Reed lying in the water, unable
    to get up. She had almost drowned.
    It turned out that the plumber had not tightened a pipe
    properly and it exploded, spraying water everywhere.
    Within a minute, Mom and Tammy had the water turned
    off. An ambulance came and took Mrs. Reed to the
    hospital.
    The newspaper found out about the hero plumbers.
    Since then, my mom and Tammy have been so busy that
    they can’t keep up with all the work.
    She’s my mom, the hero plumber. But I just call her Mom.

    An Unhappy Man
    Mr. Rock is an unhappy man. All he wants every day is to
    become rich. He himself is an electrician, which gives him
    enough money for a house and a car.
    But, he still isn’t happy. He admires the rich people and
    the way they live. He loves the power of money. Every day
    he prays to God to let him become rich. Sometimes, he
    even becomes angry with God because he thinks his
    prayers are not being answered.
    One day, he received a phone call at home. The call was
    from some tour company saying he won a grand prize in
    the lottery. The caller explained that at a recent promotion
    for the tour sites, his name and phone number had been
    selected in a contest. “You are our lucky winner,” said the
    voice on the phone. “You have won a prize valued at a
    total of $110,000.”
    Thrilled, but with some doubt about the good news, Mr.
    Rock had a careful conversation with the person. He even
    asked to speak with the person’s manager. Finally, he
    concluded that the prize was real. His luck had finally
    arrived!
    As instructed, he went to his bank to open an account. He
    prepared to receive the funds from the company. A few
    days later, another call came and he was told to send
    some money to pay the tax before his money could be
    sent to his bank account. He had to pay only $3,000 to get
    his $110,000 prize. It seemed like a good deal.
    Still, he hesitated for a few days. Then, the company told
    him there was a deadline to keep his prize valid. Painfully,
    but surely, he sent the money to the bank account they
    provided.
    The next day, he called the company to confirm that the
    money had made it through. All he got was a message
    saying that the phone number he had dialled was not a
    valid number.
    He was shocked and couldn’t believe the message.
    After calling many times, there was still no answer on the
    phone.
    He was sad. He was mad. He slapped himself on the face,
    but nothing could get his money back. In the end, he went
    to the police station to report the swindler incident.

    The Ox and the Cow
    (adapted from Aesop’s fables)
    An ox, as we all know, is born to work. Day after day, week
    after week, year after year, the faithful ox is kept in a
    harness. He pulls the plow, making it possible to grow
    food in the fields.
    From sunrise to sunset, the farmer makes the ox work.
    And working in the hot fields all day is not an easy job.
    One day at the edge of the field, a fat cow stood eating
    fresh green grass and watched the ox work under the
    heavy load. Each time the ox passed, the cow shouted
    out, tormenting the ox, “Ox, you are my brother, but you
    work hard all day. It is your fate in life to work and work.
    Look at me, Ox! Do you see the happy, easy life the
    farmer has given me? Don’t you wish you were so
    fortunate?”
    The ox was a faithful worker. He heard the words of the
    cow and was hurting inside. But he said nothing. He
    simply tensed his muscles, bent low and pulled the plow
    even harder. This went on all summer long. The cow
    teased the ox with unkind words about his misfortunes as
    a beast of burden. And yet, the ox toiled under the hot
    sun.
    At the end of summer, when all the work was done and
    the harvest safely in the barns, the farmer set the ox free.
    “You have worked hard for me,” said the thankful farmer.
    “Your labour is the most important on my farm, so walk
    freely without your harness, and rest, for you have earned
    it well, my ox.”
    The farmer then came to the field with ropes, and caught
    and tied the well-fed cow. He led her to the temple where
    the priest would sacrifice her to give thanks for the
    bountiful harvest that year.
    As the cow was being led away, the ox noticed. He looked
    at the cow and said, “So this is why you were allowed to
    live all summer in your lazy ways. You are fat, and now
    you receive your reward.”

    Special Gifts
    Grandma has never been to school. When she was
    young, her family could not afford her schooling. That was
    about 70 years ago. Grandma is still illiterate.
    Occasionally, she can recognize one or two Chinese
    written characters. She’s thrilled when she sees a
    character she knows.
    Over the years, she became a grandmother of eight.
    All her children and grandchildren have gone to school.
    She always encouraged them to do well in their studies. It
    has been her lifelong dream to go to school. She knows
    that without education, it’s difficult to do anything. Even
    watching television is not very interesting.
    Luckily, her children did not disappoint her. One after
    another, they grew up, passed their examinations, and left
    home to start university in the big city.
    Before the first granddaughter left home, Grandma made
    a special gift for her. In China, moms, dads, aunts and
    uncles often prepare “going-away” gifts such as books,
    pens and even some expensive gifts such as voice
    recorders.
    What did Grandma give her? She made a new pillow by
    hand -- a pillow filled with buckwheat hulls.
    One of her grandsons laughed at the gift. “Grandma,
    young people buy the new kind of pillows. They’re
    modern. They’re soft and comfortable,” he said. “Why
    bother spending a whole day buying buckwheat hulls,
    washing and drying them and sewing the pillow? It’s too
    much work. And it doesn’t look so good.”
    Grandma didn’t argue, but she continued her work until
    she finished making the pillow. She insisted that her
    granddaughter take the pillow when she left for university.
    “Nothing can compare to a good night’s sleep,” Grandma
    said.
    From that time, it became a tradition. All the children
    received a special homemade pillow from Grandma when
    they left home to study.
    Years have passed, and life has gone on. Now, when I see
    the new ads on TV for an expensive pillow in North
    America, I laugh. The pillow they advertise is just like the
    one my grandma made for us all those years ago -- a
    pillow filled with buckwheat hulls!

    Blame It on Bad Luck
    (adapted from a European fable)
    There is good luck and bad luck. Then there is foolishness
    which is often blamed on bad luck.
    Here is a tale to demonstrate how this works. Listen
    carefully and ask yourself, “Have I ever blamed luck for
    something foolish I have done?”
    A traveller in a strange land was tired from walking all day.
    At the moment, he could not go any further on his journey.
    He stopped in the shade of some trees at the edge of a
    wide and deep well. Being tired, he lay down very near the
    edge of the well, and fell fast asleep.
    As you know, we often toss and turn in our sleep, and that
    is exactly what the traveller began to do. He rolled on his
    side and was on the brink of falling into the well. But
    Lady Luck was watching. She immediately came and
    shook the traveller awake before he fell into the deep well.
    “Wake up, good traveller,” said Lady Luck. “You were
    about to fall into the well and drown. And of course, your
    friends and family would blame your misfortune on me,
    Lady Luck. That is why I have saved you.”
    The traveller thanked Lady Luck, promising that he had
    learned his lesson.
    For the rest of his days, he spoke kindly of Lady Luck,
    often repeating her words to others, so that they might
    take responsibility for their poor decisions.
    “I have found that I am blamed for many things,” Lady
    Luck told him. “But if you look closely, you will often find
    that luck, good or bad, had nothing to do with it.
    Misfortunes are often the result of foolishness.”

    A Day to Remember
    A friend of mine told me on Friday that one of our friends,
    Mr. Clark, had passed away. On Saturday, there would be
    a memorial service for him. So I went to the Kingdom Hall
    to pay my respects to the man I had met a few times. Mr.
    Clark died of cancer at age 39.
    Many people came to the service. The first floor was
    packed with people, so I was directed to the hall at the
    lower level. There were about one hundred people there. I
    took a seat in the front row.
    When the memorial was about to begin, one person
    stepped on the stage and started using sign language.
    That’s when I realized there were deaf people in the
    crowd. It was my first time sitting with deaf people. While
    we listened through a speaker connected to the first hall
    upstairs, they listened too -- but with a sign language
    interpreter.
    During the memorial, I learned that after college, Mr. Clark
    worked as a computer technician in the municipal
    government. Because he wanted to have more time for
    bible studies with his students, he quit his computer job
    and took a job as a janitor. He worked the night shift,
    which gave him free time in the day to do his bible study
    work with others.
    A few years later, he went to Africa as a missionary.
    Though the drought and the medical conditions were a
    constant challenge, he was happy and content.
    Two years after he came back to Canada, he got married.
    They had a baby girl one year later. Last year, he was
    diagnosed with a very bad type of cancer, but he remained
    optimistic and continued his service until his last day.
    Everyone at the memorial was deeply touched by his
    selfless nature and his love and dedication to serving God.
    At the end of the memorial, all the people stood to pray
    and sing. As the music and singing began, I realized that I
    could hear only a few voices singing. When I looked
    around, I saw the rest of the crowd was singing with hand
    gestures. Most of the crowd in this room was deaf! They
    were singing in sign language!
    Watching these people signing passionately in unison, I
    was amazed. It’s a day I will never forget.

    Sharing the Wealth
    Last year, five young students from a very poor part of the
    country visited our school. It was part of a homestay
    program.
    It was very interesting because we learned as much from
    them as they did from us.
    One of the students named Ann stayed with my family.
    She was a great kid, and we got along really well. One
    thing that was very different for her was our meals. The
    first night, she could not believe how much food we were
    eating. She tried and loved everything.
    One day, my mother was going to give us some soup for
    lunch. “Where is that can of soup I just bought?” she
    asked. None of us knew where the soup was. The next
    day, Mom realized that there were some other tins of food
    missing.
    As the week went on, more food went missing. We soon
    figured out that Ann was taking the food. Was she taking it
    home for her family? We did not know, but we did not stop
    her. We felt that it would have been too embarrassing.
    On the last day, as we were about to get in the car to go to
    the airport, my mother said to Ann, “You forgot this.” It was
    a big suitcase on wheels. Ann was surprised. It wasn’t her
    suitcase. She opened it, and it was full of food. Ann was
    so happy that she hugged everyone. She cried, and my
    mother cried too.
    When we returned from the airport, my mom asked us,
    “What do you want for lunch?” She opened the cupboard
    door and to her amazement, all the missing cans were
    back.
    Ann learned a lesson, and so did we. She learned that it’s
    never right to steal, and we learned that those of us who
    have a lot must share our wealth.
    That’s the way to make the world a better place.

    Who Do You Call Your Friends?
    One day I didn’t have anything to do. I was bored. I looked
    down the street and there was Johnny Baker. He was a lot
    older than I was and known as the bad kid on the street.
    I had been told not to play with him. I never did. But that
    day he came to me and said, “I’m going to the store. Want
    to come along or are you too chicken?” For some reason,
    I agreed.
    We went to the store and when we left, he said, “Hey, look
    what I have.” He had stolen two chocolate bars, and he
    put one in my hand. At that moment, the man from the
    store came out. Johnny ran off, but I stayed. I knew I was
    in big trouble.
    That night was very quiet at our house. My grandfather
    said to me, “One of the most important decisions you
    make in your life is who you call your friends.” Then he
    told me a story about a frog and a scorpion.
    There was once a scorpion and a frog who both lived on
    an island. One day, there was a fire, and soon the entire
    island was in flames. The frog knew he had to get off the
    island. Just as he was about to jump into the water, the
    scorpion came to him and begged, “Please help me get off
    the island! I can’t swim. Let me ride on your back!”
    “No,” said the frog. “You’ll sting me!”
    “No!” the scorpion said. “Why would I do that? If I did that,
    we’d both die!”
    The frog thought about this and finally answered, “Okay,
    get on.”
    Once they were far from the shore, the scorpion stung the
    frog in the back. The frog tried to swim, but he couldn’t
    continue. “Why did you do that?” he cried out. “Now we’ll
    both die!” The scorpion replied, “Because I am a
    scorpion.”
    When my grandfather finished telling the story, he looked
    at me and asked, “Do you understand the lesson of that
    story?” I did understand. Do you?

    Voyages of Discovery
    In modern times, we honour the bravery of astronauts. We
    look up into the sky and wonder if they will ever return
    from their voyage into the great unknown.
    It’s hard to believe, but only a short while ago, our own
    earth was as vast and unknown as space is today. Only
    500 years ago, most of the earth was unmapped. Sailing
    too far away from land was as dangerous then as it is
    today for astronauts to sail into outer space.
    But humans have always wanted to learn about the world,
    no matter what the dangers. The great Chinese explorer,
    Zheng He, proves this point.
    In 1405, at the request of the Emperor, he left China for
    the first of eight voyages of discovery that he made
    between 1405 and 1433. The fleet of ships given to Zheng
    for these voyages was known as the “fleet of friendship”,
    for this was the purpose of his trips.
    On each trip, Zheng commanded more than 20,000 men
    on hundreds of ships. He sailed the South China Sea, and
    across the Indian Ocean to eastern Africa. In total, he
    visited 30 countries and began trade with them. At each
    port, the Chinese sailors made friendships with the local
    people.
    On one voyage to Africa, Zheng purchased some rare
    animals for the Emperor. He paid fair prices for a lion, a
    leopard, an ostrich, and a giraffe, and then brought them
    to the Emperor’s palace. On each return visit, the locals
    remembered the Chinese sailors and honoured them with
    gifts and royal receptions.
    It can be said that Zheng’s eight voyages of discovery
    were important because people learned more and more
    about the earth that lay beyond China’s shores. Equally
    important, however, were the friendly diplomatic relations
    that were begun so long ago. In 1419, seventeen
    countries sent ambassadors back to China with Zheng.
    This was the beginning of a long friendship between China
    and its neighbours in South Asia and beyond to Africa.

    Lucky Penny
    My grandfather is very old and very superstitious. One
    day, he and I went for a walk. At one point, he suddenly
    stopped me. I was about to step on a crack in the road.
    “Step on a crack, and break your mother’s back!” he said.
    I laughed, but made sure that for the rest of the walk, I
    didn’t step on any cracks. A little further along, he pointed
    to the ground and said, “Look! A lucky penny! You must
    pick it up with your left hand.”
    We finished our walk and that day, Grandfather went
    home. Before he left, he smiled and said, “Remember
    what you learned on our walk!”
    A few months later, we heard the sad news that my
    grandfather had passed away. We were all very sad. To
    remember him, I went for a walk on the same streets
    where we had walked together, and I made sure not to
    step on any cracks.
    I was about to cross a busy street when I looked down
    and saw a penny. I immediately thought of my grandfather
    and picked it up. Suddenly, I realized I had picked it up
    with my right hand. Knowing that Grandfather would not
    approve of this, I put it down and picked it up with my left
    hand.
    So I missed the light and had to wait. Just then, a car went
    zooming through the red light, exactly where I would have
    been crossing if I hadn’t been delayed. I could almost see
    myself walking in front of the speeding car.
    I didn’t know if that penny was good luck or if my
    grandfather was looking out for me, but I know one thing --
    I always pick up a lucky penny and always, always with
    my left hand. It may sound silly, but it’s the way I
    remember my grandfather. I know for sure that he would
    approve.

    An Amazing Friend
    Bill was a popular kid at school. He played some sports
    and was part of the debate team. His favourite subject
    was history, but he was very good in math and science.
    One day, a new boy named Harry came to the school. He
    was a little different. He didn’t seem to care about school
    and he didn’t do his work. He barely passed his tests. But
    he was good at wrestling, and both he and Bill were
    accepted to the wrestling team. Unfortunately, Bill started
    to hang out with Harry.
    Within a few months, Bill and Harry were together all the
    time. Once opposites, they were now very much the same.
    Bill’s marks began to sink. His behaviour got worse too.
    One day, they got caught lighting a firecracker in the
    washroom. People could not believe how much Bill had
    changed. But inside, Bill knew that he was being dragged
    down.
    One day, he and Harry had a fight about it, and they
    stopped being friends. People were glad to see that Bill
    had realized that Harry was a bad influence. The two boys
    ignored each other for about a week.
    Then one day, in history class, the teacher asked a
    question, but no one knew the answer. Not even Bill. The
    teacher waited and was about to give the answer.
    Suddenly, up went Harry’s hand. He actually knew the
    answer! Everyone was shocked, especially Bill.
    During the rest of that class, Harry answered and asked
    questions. Soon, Harry was actually carrying books to
    class, and he became involved in school. His marks
    became quite good, and people realized that he was a
    smart person.
    Harry said that his friendship with Bill meant so much to
    him that he needed to change his life.
    Harry told Bill, “I needed to change, and being your friend
    gave me a reason to do it.”
    We can all learn a lesson from this. People can change.
    The power of friendship is amazing. Do you have an
    amazing friend?

    The World’s Oldest Tree
    Some people have the strangest hobbies. They’re not
    content with normal hobbies such as collecting stamps or
    taking photographs. They’re inspired by doing things that
    most people would never do.
    My friend’s uncle has a weird hobby like that. He spends
    his retirement time travelling to see some of the oldest
    things on Earth.
    Last year, he went to see the world’s oldest tree. Or at
    least, that’s what he thought. It’s in California, and it’s
    4,770 years old. It’s called Methuselah, located in the
    Ancient Bristlecone Pine Forest. It’s high in the mountains
    at an altitude about 3,500 metres. All of the trees in this
    forest are at least 4,000 years old. But Methuselah is the
    oldest.
    You might expect this to be a really big tree. But that’s not
    the case at all. In fact, it’s quite small. It’s only 15 metres
    tall, and its trunk is not really that big either. It grows only a
    few centimetres a year.
    Why does it live so long? You might assume that for a tree
    to live so long it would need perfect conditions to survive,
    such as plenty of water, a good moderate climate and rich
    soil for its roots to gather food. But just the opposite is
    true. The place where it lives gets really cold, sometimes
    there is no water, and the soil has almost no nutrients. In
    fact, this tree’s difficult life makes it strong. That’s why it
    has lived so long.
    Want to hear something funny? When my friend’s uncle
    returned from his trip to see Methuselah last year, he read
    an article in a newspaper. It was about the world’s oldest
    tree. He was surprised to hear that a tree was recently
    discovered in Sweden that is 9,550 years old. You can
    imagine his astonishment! That tree is nearly twice as old
    as Methuselah.
    My friend’s uncle doesn’t give up, though. Next year, he’s
    going to Sweden to see this tree. That’s the way hobbies
    work. You set your goals, and you do what it takes to
    achieve them.

    The Missing Money
    Being a police officer is hard work, but it can be very
    interesting, especially when you solve a hard case.
    Sergeant O’Hara was a detective. He found a missing
    suitcase in which he knew there was $50,000. The police
    officer opened the case, but instead of money, there was a
    toothbrush, a hair brush, a watch and an opened letter.
    But where was the money? The policeman continued the
    investigation and the search for the money. Was it in the
    lining of the case? Were there little pieces of gold in the
    handle? It was a mystery for sure.
    Sergeant O’Hara puzzled over the case for a long time.
    He checked the watch. It was worth nothing. The letter
    said nothing important, and the hairbrush was worthless
    too.
    In the end, the case was not solved and all the evidence
    was put away.
    Sometime later, a cleaner was working at the police
    station. He was taking a break and reading a magazine.
    Sergeant O’Hara saw the old man and said hello to him.
    The old man said hello back. “What are you reading?”
    asked the sergeant. “It’s a magazine about my hobby,”
    replied the old man. “I’m a philatelist.”
    “I’ve heard of that,” remarked O’Hara. Suddenly, his face
    went white. “Come with me,” he said. And he took the old
    man upstairs.
    The policeman dumped the suitcase in front of the old
    man and said, “I’m looking for $50,000 in this suitcase.
    Can you see it?”
    The old man pulled out his reading glasses. He could not
    believe his eyes. He picked up the envelope containing
    the letter. The old man said, “I just found it.” O’Hara
    smiled. The case was solved.
    You’re probably wondering how this man’s hobby helped
    O’Hara discover the missing $50,000 in that suitcase.
    It’s easy. A philatelist is an expert in stamps. The envelope
    had a rare and expensive stamp attached to it. The old
    man recognized its value immediately.

    Jonah and the Big Fish
    (adapted from a Bible story)
    In ancient times, there lived a young man named Jonah.
    He was a person who tried his best to do what God asked.
    For this, his creator favoured him. At that time, there was a
    city where many bad people lived. They thought they were
    wiser than their creator.
    The creator wanted to give the people in this city a chance
    to change their ways. He wanted to teach them how to live
    a good and happy life. He chose Jonah to deliver this
    message.
    “Go to this city, Jonah,” said the creator. “Tell the people
    there that I am not pleased. Tell them they must change
    their ways, or bad things will happen to them.”
    Jonah, however, did not wish to go to that city. He had
    other plans. When he got in a boat with some men, he
    ordered them to set sail in the opposite direction of where
    he was supposed to go. Suddenly, a big wind came, and
    the sea grew dangerous. Everyone in the boat was
    frightened. Jonah realized that he was the cause of the
    storm. He had not listened to his creator. And for this, he
    was being punished.
    There was only one thing to do. To save everyone in the
    boat, Jonah jumped into the sea. He sank deep into the
    water. Suddenly, a big fish came and opened its mouth.
    The fish swallowed Jonah in one bite. For three days and
    three nights, Jonah was trapped in the stomach of the
    giant fish. He was frightened. He did not know what to do.
    Then, he began to pray. He asked his creator to forgive
    him for disobeying. For a long time, he prayed in the cold,
    dark stomach of the big fish. Suddenly, the fish opened its
    mouth and spit Jonah out.
    Jonah made it safely to shore. He immediately travelled to
    the bad city where God had told him to go. And for the rest
    of his life, Jonah obeyed his creator.
