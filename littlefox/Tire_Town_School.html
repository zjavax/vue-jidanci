    Tire Town School 5: Field Trip<br />
    Eddy saw his friends at school.<br />
    “Hi, Eddy!” called Poppy.<br />
    Honk! Honk!<br />
    She tooted her horn.<br />
    Eddy laughed.<br />
    Poppy was always silly.<br />
    “Field trip today,” said Dipper.<br />
    “Yay!” said Poppy.<br />
    “Where are we going?”<br />
    “Maybe to a construction site,” said Jeb.<br />
    Eddy saw the teacher.<br />
    “Good morning,” said Mr. Grill.<br />
    “Ready for our field trip?”<br />
    “Yes!” said Poppy.<br />
    “Where are we going?” asked Zippy.<br />
    “It's a surprise,” said Mr. Grill.<br />
    “Everyone, follow me!”<br />
    “Yay!” the students cheered.<br />
    Honk! Honk! Vroom!<br />
    They turned into a parking lot.<br />
    Eddy saw a blue building.<br />
    The building was noisy.<br />
    A sign said Car Wash.<br />
    Mr. Grill smiled.<br />
    “It's bath time!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 6: The Car Wash<br />
    “The car wash stinks!” said Jeb.<br />
    “This field trip is terrible!”<br />
    The car wash made loud sounds.<br />
    Hiss! Wump! Wump! Wump!<br />
    Poppy was quiet.<br />
    She backed away from the building.<br />
    “Everyone is dirty,” said Mr. Grill.<br />
    “I like dirt,” said Jeb.<br />
    “Dirt feels good,” said Eddy.<br />
    Mr. Grill smiled.<br />
    “I know you like dirt.<br />
    But it's time to get clean.”<br />
    “I like to be clean,” said Zippy.<br />
    “It helps me go fast!”<br />
    Mr. Grill looked at the students.<br />
    “Who will go first?” he asked.<br />
    Eddy looked at Zippy.<br />
    Then he looked at himself.<br />
    He saw lots of dirt.<br />
    Eddy wanted to be fast.<br />
    He looked at Mr. Grill.<br />
    “I'll go first,” said Eddy.<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 7: Eddy in the Car Wash<br />
    Eddy drove into the car wash.<br />
    Hiss! Wump! Wump! Wump!<br />
    The building was noisy.<br />
    Water splashed on Eddy.<br />
    “Whoa!” he said.<br />
    Bubbles were everywhere.<br />
    Big brushes spun.<br />
    They cleaned his sides.<br />
    The brushes cleaned Eddy's top.<br />
    They cleaned his tires.<br />
    Eddy laughed. “That tickles!”<br />
    More water sprayed.<br />
    Suds dripped off Eddy.<br />
    Eddy came out of the car wash.<br />
    “That was fun!” he said.<br />
    “Who will go next?” Mr. Grill asked.<br />
    “Me!” the students shouted.<br />
    Everyone got clean.<br />
    Even Jeb sparkled.<br />
    “I love the car wash!” he said.<br />
    Finally it was Poppy's turn.<br />
    Poppy frowned.<br />
    “I am not going in there!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 8: Poppy Is Scared<br />
    Poppy looked at the noisy building.<br />
    “I'm not going in,” she said.<br />
    “The car wash is scary!”<br />
    “It's not scary,” said Mr. Grill.<br />
    “It makes strange sounds,” said Poppy.<br />
    “Ha-ha!” said Zippy.<br />
    “Poppy is afraid!”<br />
    Poppy frowned.<br />
    “The car wash is fun,” said Jeb.<br />
    “It has big brushes.”<br />
    “Brushes aren't fun,” said Poppy.<br />
    “It sprays you with water,” said Dipper.<br />
    “Hmm,” said Poppy.<br />
    “Water is kind of fun.”<br />
    “There are bubbles,” said Eddy.<br />
    Poppy's eyes got wide.<br />
    “Bubbles?” she said.<br />
    “I love bubbles!”<br />
    Honk! Honk!<br />
    Poppy raced into the car wash.<br />
    “Woo-hoo!” she cried.<br />
    “This is fun!”<br />
    Everyone went back to school.<br />
    “I love the car wash!” said Poppy.<br />
    “That was the best field trip!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 9: Fast Eddy<br />
    Vroom! Vroom!<br />
    Eddy zoomed around.<br />
    “Way to go, Eddy!” said Jeb.<br />
    “You're fast!” said Dipper.<br />
    Honk! Honk!<br />
    Poppy tooted her horn.<br />
    Eddy grinned.<br />
    “Someday I'll be a race car!” he said.<br />
    “No, you won't,” said Zippy.<br />
    “You're too slow!”<br />
    Eddy frowned.<br />
    Ms. Fender came outside.<br />
    “Good morning!” said the teacher.<br />
    “It's time for safety class.”<br />
    “Safety class?” said Zippy.<br />
    “That's boring!”<br />
    “Safety is important,” said Ms. Fender.<br />
    She led everyone to a track.<br />
    Eddy saw cones.<br />
    He saw stop signs.<br />
    He saw traffic lights.<br />
    “We'll practice here,” said Ms. Fender.<br />
    “Everyone will drive on the track.<br />
    Don't go too fast.”<br />
    Zippy laughed.<br />
    “This will be easy for Eddy.<br />
    He's slow!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 10: Safety Class<br />
    Jeb drove between the cones.<br />
    “Very safe driving!” said Ms. Fender.<br />
    Jeb drove toward a stop sign.<br />
    “Obey the sign,” said Ms. Fender.<br />
    Jeb stopped at the sign.<br />
    He looked both ways.<br />
    Then he drove some more.<br />
    A green light turned yellow.<br />
    Jeb slowed down.<br />
    The light turned red.<br />
    Jeb stopped.<br />
    Zippy whispered to Eddy.<br />
    “You're good at slowing down.<br />
    Because you're slow!”<br />
    “I'm not slow,” said Eddy.<br />
    The light turned green.<br />
    Jeb drove some more.<br />
    Soon he was done.<br />
    “Good job,” said Ms. Fender.<br />
    “It's Zippy's turn now.”<br />
    Zippy drove to the track.<br />
    Zippy smiled. “This will be easy!”<br />
    “I'm the best at everything!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 11: Not Too Fast<br />
    Zippy drove very fast.<br />
    But he didn't hit the cones.<br />
    And he stopped at the sign.<br />
    “Good job, Zippy,” said Ms. Fender.<br />
    “But next time go slow.”<br />
    “Sorry,” said Zippy.<br />
    “I'm just too fast!”<br />
    Eddy frowned.<br />
    Poppy went next.<br />
    Honk! Honk!<br />
    Poppy knocked over a cone.<br />
    “Whee!” she cried.<br />
    “Stop being silly, Poppy!” said Ms. Fender.<br />
    “Sorry!” said Poppy.<br />
    “La, la, la, la!” Poppy sang.<br />
    She drove past the stop sign.<br />
    “You didn't stop!” cried Ms. Fender.<br />
    “Sorry!” said Poppy.<br />
    Then it was Eddy's turn.<br />
    “Remember, Eddy,” said Ms. Fender.<br />
    “Don't go too fast.”<br />
    Zippy laughed. “Don't worry, Ms. Fender.<br />
    Eddy won't go too fast!”<br />
    Eddy's engine roared.<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 12: Eddy Is Not Safe<br />
    Eddy drove onto the track.<br />
    “Slow, slow, slow!” Zippy sang.<br />
    Eddy gritted his teeth.<br />
    Eddy drove between the cones.<br />
    He saw the stop sign.<br />
    Eddy slowed down.<br />
    “You are really slow!” Zippy laughed.<br />
    Eddy felt hot.<br />
    His dumper shook.<br />
    “I'm not slow!” Eddy yelled.<br />
    Vroom!<br />
    Eddy went fast—too fast!<br />
    “Slow down!” cried Ms. Fender.<br />
    Eddy flew past a red light.<br />
    He crashed into cones.<br />
    “That was not safe!” said Ms. Fender.<br />
    Eddy sighed. “I'm sorry.”<br />
    “Zippy,” said Ms. Fender.<br />
    “You must stop being a bully.”<br />
    “Fine,” Zippy said.<br />
    Eddy drove on the track again.<br />
    “Eddy is slow,” said Zippy.<br />
    “No! Eddy is safe!” said Ms. Fender.<br />
    Everyone honked.<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 13: Something New<br />
    “Good morning,” said Mr. Grill.<br />
    “We will do something new today!”<br />
    “Will we go fast?” asked Zippy.<br />
    He looked at Eddy and grinned.<br />
    Eddy frowned.<br />
    “Will we tell jokes?” asked Poppy.<br />
    “Nope,” said Mr. Grill.<br />
    “Follow me!”<br />
    The teacher drove down the road.<br />
    Eddy saw lots of trees.<br />
    “Hmm,” he thought.<br />
    “Where are we going?”<br />
    “We're here!” said Mr. Grill.<br />
    Eddy saw a wide path.<br />
    It led into the woods.<br />
    Mr. Grill smiled.<br />
    “We're going off-road!”<br />
    Eddy smiled.<br />
    “Wow!” he said.<br />
    “Cool!” said Jeb.<br />
    “Fun!” said Dipper.<br />
    “Yay!” said Poppy.<br />
    “I hope the path is bumpy!”<br />
    Zippy frowned.<br />
    “This stinks!” he cried.<br />
    “I hate going off-road!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 14: The Dirt Path<br />
    Eddy smiled.<br />
    “I love driving off-road.<br />
    Dirt and rocks feel good!”<br />
    Poppy tooted her horn.<br />
    Honk! Honk!<br />
    “Ugh,” said Zippy.<br />
    “I have to drive slowly.<br />
    And I'll get dirty.”<br />
    “You'll be fine, Zippy,” said Mr. Grill.<br />
    Everyone drove into the woods.<br />
    The path had lots of rocks.<br />
    Jeb rolled over the rocks.<br />
    Dipper drove around them.<br />
    Poppy bumped up and down.<br />
    “Whee!” she said.<br />
    “This is fun!” said Eddy.<br />
    He rolled over a big rock.<br />
    A tree branch hit Zippy.<br />
    “Oof!” he said.<br />
    His tire hit a rock.<br />
    “Ouch!” said Zippy.<br />
    “Everybody, get ready!” said Mr. Grill.<br />
    “The path gets muddy soon!”<br />
    “Yay!” shouted everyone.<br />
    “Ugh!” moaned Zippy.<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 15: Mud<br />
    Zippy did not like dirt paths.<br />
    He did not like rocks.<br />
    “This stinks,” said Zippy.<br />
    “I have to drive slowly.<br />
    And these rocks hurt!”<br />
    Eddy grinned.<br />
    Now he was faster than Zippy!<br />
    “I see mud!” cried Poppy.<br />
    Everybody drove through the mud.<br />
    “Oh no!” said Zippy.<br />
    “My tires are muddy!”<br />
    Eddy went fast in the mud.<br />
    The mud splashed.<br />
    Splat!<br />
    Mud sprayed all over Zippy.<br />
    “Hey!” cried Zippy.<br />
    Poppy splashed in the mud.<br />
    Splat!<br />
    “Ugh!” cried Zippy.<br />
    Jeb and Dipper splashed in the mud.<br />
    Splat! Splat!<br />
    Zippy spun his tires.<br />
    But the mud was deep.<br />
    His tires went deeper.<br />
    “Oh no!” cried Zippy.<br />
    “I'm stuck in the mud!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 16: Deep Mud<br />
    Zippy spun his tires.<br />
    He spun them very fast.<br />
    Mud sprayed everywhere.<br />
    But Zippy didn't move.<br />
    Zippy sank deeper.<br />
    “Help!” he cried.<br />
    “I'll help you,” said Mr. Grill.<br />
    The teacher pushed.<br />
    Zippy moved a little bit.<br />
    But then Mr. Grill sank too.<br />
    “Help!” he cried.<br />
    “Uh-oh!” said Dipper.<br />
    Poppy gulped.<br />
    Eddy looked at Jeb.<br />
    Jeb looked at Eddy.<br />
    “Let's clear that mud,” said Eddy.<br />
    The two friends moved fast.<br />
    Shloomp!<br />
    Jeb scooped the mud.<br />
    He put it in Eddy's dumper.<br />
    Soon everyone was free!<br />
    “Thank you,” said Mr. Grill.<br />
    “You're welcome,” said Eddy and Jeb.<br />
    Eddy zoomed along the path.<br />
    “I love driving off-road!”<br />
    Zippy groaned. “I don't!”<br />
