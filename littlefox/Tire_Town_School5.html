    Tire Town School 52: Really Loud<br />
    “Yesterday was fun,” Poppy said.<br />
    The friends were at school.<br />
    “Yeah,” said Eddy.<br />
    “Gasser is cool.”<br />
    Zippy was driving by.<br />
    He stopped.<br />
    “Who’s Gasser?” he asked.<br />
    “Gasser is our new friend,” Dipper said.<br />
    “He’s a monster truck.”<br />
    Zippy laughed.<br />
    “Monster trucks look silly,” he said.<br />
    “Their tires are too big!”<br />
    Zippy laughed some more.<br />
    A shadow appeared behind him.<br />
    He didn’t see it.<br />
    “Monster trucks are dumb!” Zippy said.<br />
    “They’re not scary at all!”<br />
    The shadow’s engine roared.<br />
    Brumm, brumm, brumm!<br />
    “Ahh!” Zippy screamed.<br />
    He zoomed away.<br />
    The friends gasped.<br />
    “Gasser, it’s you!” cried Poppy.<br />
    “Surprise!” Gasser said.<br />
    “This is my new school!”<br />
    Eddy and his friends cheered.<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 53: The Old Cars’ Home<br />
    “We’re here,” Dipper said.<br />
    “Tire Town Old Cars’ Home.”<br />
    It was Saturday.<br />
    The friends were meeting Dipper’s grandma.<br />
    “This place is nice,” Eddy said.<br />
    “I see a garden,” Poppy said.<br />
    Jeb looked around.<br />
    “Does this place have dirt?” he asked.<br />
    “Nope,” Dipper said.<br />
    “Older cars don’t like dirt.”<br />
    “I don’t see any piles,” said Gasser.<br />
    “There’s nothing to jump over.”<br />
    “Of course not,” Dipper said.<br />
    “Older cars don’t jump over piles.”<br />
    Some cars and trucks drove over.<br />
    “Dipper!” said an ice cream truck.<br />
    “Hi, Grandma!” Dipper said.<br />
    “These are my friends.”<br />
    The older cars smiled at Eddy.<br />
    They smiled at Poppy and Jeb.<br />
    But then the cars saw Gasser.<br />
    “Oh no!” one car said.<br />
    “That truck is scary!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 54: The Dirt Pile<br />
    “Gasser is a monster truck,” Dipper said.<br />
    “But he’s really nice.”<br />
    “I’m Carlin,” said an old van.<br />
    “What do monster trucks do?”<br />
    “I drive on dirt,” Gasser said.<br />
    “I also jump over stuff.”<br />
    “That sounds fun,” Carlin said.<br />
    “It sure does!” Grandma said.<br />
    “Ha-ha, Grandma,” Dipper said.<br />
    “You don’t jump over stuff.”<br />
    “Come on,” Carlin said.<br />
    “We’ll show you kids around.”<br />
    Grandma and Carlin led the way.<br />
    “The garden is so pretty,” Poppy said.<br />
    “Look,” Grandma said.<br />
    “Do you see our new pond?”<br />
    “I see dirt!” Jeb said.<br />
    “That’s a big pile!” Eddy said.<br />
    “Workers left it,” Grandma said.<br />
    “They dug out the pond.<br />
    That’s the dirt from the hole.”<br />
    “The dirt doesn’t look nice,” Carlin said.<br />
    Suddenly—<br />
    crunch!<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 55: Ruining the Garden<br />
    “Oh no!” Gasser said.<br />
    A broken statue lay under him.<br />
    “I’m sorry,” Gasser said.<br />
    “I was looking at the dirt.<br />
    I didn’t see the statue.”<br />
    “That’s okay,” Grandma said.<br />
    “No big deal,” Carlin said.<br />
    “There is more to see!” Grandma said.<br />
    Everyone followed her.<br />
    Smoosh!<br />
    “Uh-oh,” Poppy said.<br />
    “Gasser ran over some flowers!”<br />
    “Please be careful!” Dipper whispered.<br />
    “Sorry,” Gasser said.<br />
    “Don’t worry,” Eddy said.<br />
    “We know you didn’t mean to.”<br />
    “I like this fountain,” Jeb said.<br />
    “It looks like a boat.”<br />
    “This way,” Carlin said.<br />
    Everyone followed.<br />
    Clunk!<br />
    “Ugh!” Gasser cried.<br />
    “My tire knocked over the fountain!”<br />
    He backed into a sign.<br />
    Smash!<br />
    “I’m too big!” Gasser cried.<br />
    “I’m ruining the garden!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 56 : Eddy and Jeb’s Surprise<br />
    Gasser was sad.<br />
    “Don’t be sad,” Poppy said.<br />
    “We can fix everything,” Dipper said.<br />
    “I’ll help,” Carlin said.<br />
    “Jeb, I have an idea,” Eddy said.<br />
    “Follow me.”<br />
    Eddy and Jeb went to the dirt pile.<br />
    Everyone else got to work.<br />
    Dipper planted new flowers.<br />
    Carlin fixed the sign.<br />
    Gasser stood the fountain back up.<br />
    Poppy cleaned up the broken statue.<br />
    Soon the garden looked nice again.<br />
    Gasser smiled.<br />
    Eddy came back.<br />
    “Hey, everyone,” he said.<br />
    “Jeb and I have a surprise!”<br />
    Eddy led everyone to the dirt.<br />
    The pile was gone.<br />
    Now there was a dirt track.<br />
    “That looks fun!” Carlin said.<br />
    “It sure does!” Grandma said.<br />
    Everyone drove on the track.<br />
    Grandma jumped a ramp.<br />
    “Whee!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 57: A Mystery<br />
    Eddy, Jeb, and Gasser were playing.<br />
    “I love dirt,” Jeb said.<br />
    “I love jumping!” Gasser said.<br />
    He drove fast toward a pile.<br />
    Gasser flew through the air.<br />
    Mr. Grill came outside.<br />
    “Good morning, students!” he said.<br />
    “Do we have safety class today?” Zippy asked.<br />
    “That’s so boring.”<br />
    “No,” Mr. Grill said.<br />
    “We’re doing something fun today.”<br />
    “What is it?” Eddy asked.<br />
    “Tell us!” Poppy said.<br />
    Mr. Grill smiled.<br />
    “I’m not telling yet.<br />
    It’s a mystery!”<br />
    “When will you tell us?” Jeb asked.<br />
    “This afternoon,” Mr. Grill said.<br />
    “Meet me in the parking lot.”<br />
    That afternoon the students met.<br />
    They parked in the parking lot.<br />
    “Um,” Dipper said.<br />
    “Where is Mr. Grill?”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 58: Where Is Mr. Grill？<br />
    “Where is Mr. Grill?” Jeb asked.<br />
    “He said to meet here.”<br />
    “Maybe he forgot,” Poppy said.<br />
    “I don’t think so,” Dipper said.<br />
    Everyone looked around.<br />
    But they didn’t see the teacher.<br />
    “Hey!” Gasser said.<br />
    “What’s this?”<br />
    Eddy saw a sheet of paper.<br />
    There was an oval on it.<br />
    “Hmm,” Eddy said.<br />
    “It looks like a racetrack.”<br />
    Poppy gasped.<br />
    “I bet Mr. Grill left it!” she said.<br />
    Everyone looked confused.<br />
    “Why did he leave it?” Zippy asked.<br />
    “So we can find him,” Poppy said.<br />
    “I think it’s a clue.”<br />
    “Oh, fun!” Dipper said.<br />
    “Let’s go to the racetrack!”<br />
    Everyone hurried to the racetrack.<br />
    Eddy saw a sign.<br />
    It said, “Race!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 59: Another Clue<br />
    “Let’s race!” Zippy said.<br />
    He zoomed off.<br />
    Eddy drove fast.<br />
    He zipped around a bend.<br />
    Eddy saw Zippy.<br />
    Zippy was reading another sign.<br />
    Everyone else stopped.<br />
    “What does the sign say?” Gasser asked.<br />
    “It says, ‘Dig!’” Zippy said.<br />
    “Hmm,” Poppy said.<br />
    “Where will we dig?”<br />
    “I know where to dig,” Jeb said.<br />
    “At the construction site!”<br />
    Everyone went to the construction site.<br />
    Jeb dug.<br />
    He dug deep.<br />
    He dug up a box.<br />
    Poppy opened the box.<br />
    “It’s a horn,” she said.<br />
    “Another clue,” Eddy said.<br />
    “Honk the horn, Poppy.”<br />
    Honk!<br />
    Poppy honked the horn.<br />
    Nothing happened.<br />
    Eddy sighed.<br />
    “Now what do we do?”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 60: Honk, Honk!<br />
    “Look!” Dipper said.<br />
    “There’s a picture in the box.”<br />
    The picture showed a road.<br />
    An<br />
    X<br />
    was next to it.<br />
    “Oh!” Eddy said.<br />
    “We’re going to drive off-road.”<br />
    “How do you know?” Jeb said.<br />
    “See the<br />
    X<br />
    ?” Eddy said.<br />
    “It is<br />
    off<br />
    the road.”<br />
    “You’re smart, Eddy,” Poppy said.<br />
    “So where do we go?” Gasser asked.<br />
    “Where can we drive off-road?”<br />
    “In the woods,” Eddy said.<br />
    “Follow me!”<br />
    Everyone drove along the trail.<br />
    They came to a stop sign.<br />
    Eddy looked around.<br />
    He didn’t see any clues.<br />
    Honk!<br />
    Poppy honked the horn.<br />
    Suddenly—<br />
    Honk, honk!<br />
    Someone honked back!<br />
    “It’s Mr. Grill!” Dipper cried.<br />
    “Good job, everyone,” Mr. Grill said.<br />
    “You found me!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 61: Amazing News<br />
    Eddy and his friends were playing.<br />
    Jeb chased Poppy.<br />
    Zippy zoomed by.<br />
    “You’re all slow!” he said.<br />
    Ms. Fender came outside.<br />
    “Come here, everyone!” she called.<br />
    “I have some news!”<br />
    Everyone hurried over.<br />
    “What is it?” Dipper asked.<br />
    “Field trip tomorrow!” Ms. Fender said.<br />
    “Someone will do something amazing!”<br />
    “I’ll bet it’s a race,” Zippy said.<br />
    “Someone will go fast!”<br />
    Zippy zoomed around the parking lot.<br />
    “No, Zippy,” Ms. Fender said.<br />
    “We’re not going to a race.”<br />
    “Will someone build something?” Jeb asked.<br />
    “Nope,” Ms. Fender said.<br />
    “Will a car do jumps?” Gasser asked.<br />
    “Nope,” Ms. Fender said.<br />
    “What is it then?” Eddy asked.<br />
    “Tell us!” Poppy cried.<br />
    Ms. Fender grinned.<br />
    “Someone will say good-bye!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 62: The Spaceport<br />
    Everyone drove along the road.<br />
    “Hmm,” Eddy thought.<br />
    “Who’s going to say good-bye?”<br />
    “We’re here,” Ms. Fender said.<br />
    “The Tire Town Spaceport.<br />
    Please follow the rules.”<br />
    Everyone gasped.<br />
    “I see a rocket!” Jeb said.<br />
    “His name is Rocky,” Ms. Fender said.<br />
    “He’s going to space.<br />
    We’ll watch him blast off!”<br />
    “Whoa,” Dipper said.<br />
    “Space is so cool,” Poppy said.<br />
    Gasser stared at Rocky.<br />
    His eyes were big.<br />
    “I never saw a rocket before!”<br />
    “Me neither,” Eddy said.<br />
    “Rockets are so fast!”<br />
    “Ms. Fender!” Gasser called.<br />
    “Can we meet Rocky?”<br />
    “Yes,” Ms. Fender said.<br />
    “We’re going to meet him now.”<br />
    “Cool,” Eddy said.<br />
    “I can’t wait to meet Rocky.”<br />
    Zippy laughed.<br />
    “You’re slow!” he said.<br />
    “Rocky won’t want to meet you!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 63: Rocky<br />
    “Zippy is mean,” Eddy thought.<br />
    He drove away from Zippy.<br />
    Eddy watched the busy spaceport.<br />
    A fuel truck drove by.<br />
    “I’m bringing fuel to Rocky!”<br />
    “Let’s meet Rocky,” Ms. Fender said.<br />
    They drove over to the rocket.<br />
    Eddy blinked.<br />
    Rocky was huge!<br />
    “Hi, kids!” Rocky said.<br />
    “Will you watch me blast off?”<br />
    “Yes!” everyone yelled.<br />
    “My job is important,” Rocky said.<br />
    “I’m bringing things to space.”<br />
    “How will you do that?” Jeb asked.<br />
    “My engine is strong,” Rocky said.<br />
    “I can fly very fast.”<br />
    “I’m fast too,” Zippy said.<br />
    “Watch this!”<br />
    Zippy sped off.<br />
    Zoom!<br />
    He shot across the spaceport.<br />
    “Uh-oh,” Eddy said.<br />
    “Zippy is breaking the rules.”<br />
    Ms. Fender beeped her horn.<br />
    “No speeding, Zippy!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 64: Blastoff!<br />
    Zippy zoomed around the spaceport.<br />
    Trucks jumped out of the way.<br />
    Zippy laughed.<br />
    Then he gasped.<br />
    Zippy was speeding toward a truck.<br />
    The truck was carrying a satellite.<br />
    Zippy slammed his brakes and slid.<br />
    Bam!<br />
    Zippy crashed into the truck.<br />
    “My wheel is broken!” the truck said.<br />
    “I can’t bring Rocky this satellite.”<br />
    “Jeb and I can help!” Eddy said.<br />
    Eddy and Jeb hurried over.<br />
    Jeb picked up the satellite.<br />
    He put it in Eddy’s dumper.<br />
    Eddy drove it to Rocky.<br />
    Ms. Fender went to Zippy.<br />
    “You’re in big trouble,” she said.<br />
    “Get ready!” a voice said.<br />
    “Blastoff is in ten seconds!”<br />
    Everyone counted down.<br />
    “Good-bye!” Rocky said.<br />
    Rumble!<br />
    Rumble!<br />
    Rocky blasted off.<br />
    Eddy waved. “Bye, Rocky!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 65: Tire Town Beach<br />
    “I love the beach!” Dipper said.<br />
    “Me too,” Eddy said.<br />
    “The sun feels warm.”<br />
    “This is boring,” Zippy said.<br />
    “I can’t go fast on sand!”<br />
    The cars were on a field trip.<br />
    They were at Tire Town Beach.<br />
    “The water looks fun,” said Dipper.<br />
    Ms. Fender frowned.<br />
    “Don’t forget.<br />
    Cars cannot go in the water.”<br />
    Jeb dug sand.<br />
    He loaded it in Eddy’s dumper.<br />
    A boat floated on the sea.<br />
    “Wow,” Dipper said.<br />
    “I wish we could float.”<br />
    Poppy nodded.<br />
    “The water looks fun,” she said.<br />
    “It sure does!” Gasser said.<br />
    Gasser looked around.<br />
    “I don’t see Ms. Fender,” he said.<br />
    Brumm, brumm!<br />
    Gasser went fast.<br />
    Gasser zoomed through the water.<br />
    It splashed everyone!<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 66: Gasser’s Big Splash<br />
    Water splashed.<br />
    “Yay!” Dipper cheered.<br />
    Gasser drove through the water again.<br />
    Splash!<br />
    “Do it again, Gasser!” Poppy said.<br />
    Just then Ms. Fender drove over.<br />
    “Gasser,” she said.<br />
    “Stop that right now!”<br />
    Gasser frowned.<br />
    “Sorry,” he said.<br />
    “Just play in the sand,” Ms. Fender said.<br />
    “Water is not for cars!”<br />
    Ms. Fender drove off.<br />
    Gasser waited for a moment.<br />
    “Ms. Fender is gone,” he said.<br />
    Brumm, brumm!<br />
    Gasser sped through the water again.<br />
    Everyone laughed.<br />
    “The water feels great,” Dipper said.<br />
    “I’m going in!”<br />
    “No, Dipper!” Eddy said.<br />
    “It’s fine,” Dipper said.<br />
    Dipper drove into the water.<br />
    She went in deeper and deeper.<br />
    Dipper called to her friends.<br />
    “Come on in!” she said.<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 67: Splashing and Playing<br />
    “The water feels nice!” Dipper said.<br />
    “You should come out,” Jeb said.<br />
    “Yeah,” Eddy said.<br />
    “Ms. Fender will be mad.”<br />
    But Dipper didn’t listen.<br />
    She went in even deeper.<br />
    Poppy went closer to the water.<br />
    The others followed.<br />
    Brumm, brumm!<br />
    Gasser splashed into the water.<br />
    Everyone laughed.<br />
    Jeb scooped some water.<br />
    Eddy dipped his tire.<br />
    “I’m going in,” Zippy said.<br />
    He drove into the waves.<br />
    “Me too!” Jeb said.<br />
    He splashed into the water.<br />
    Poppy went in next.<br />
    “Come on, Eddy!” she said.<br />
    Eddy went in.<br />
    “This is fun!” he said.<br />
    Everyone splashed and played.<br />
    Pop!<br />
    “Uh-oh!” Eddy said.<br />
    “My engine stopped!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 68: Toots<br />
    “This is bad!” Eddy said.<br />
    “I can’t drive!”<br />
    “Me neither!” Dipper cried.<br />
    “What will we do?”<br />
    Ms. Fender came over.<br />
    She gasped. “Water is not for cars!”<br />
    “We’re sorry!” Dipper said.<br />
    “Now we’re stuck!”<br />
    Ms. Fender sighed.<br />
    “I’ll get help,” she said.<br />
    A small boat arrived.<br />
    “I’m Toots,” she said.<br />
    Toots pushed everyone onto the sand.<br />
    “Stay on land,” Toots said.<br />
    “Water is not for cars.”<br />
    The cars still couldn’t drive.<br />
    “Your engines are wet,” Ms. Fender said.<br />
    “The sun will dry them.”<br />
    Soon Eddy’s engine was dry.<br />
    The others could drive too.<br />
    Everyone drove back to school.<br />
    “What did you learn today?” Ms. Fender asked.<br />
    “Water is fun,” Dipper said.<br />
    “But it is not for cars!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 69: A Talent<br />
    “Did you hear?” Dipper asked.<br />
    “Hear what?” Eddy asked.<br />
    “We’re having a talent show!” Dipper said.<br />
    “I will play music in it!”<br />
    Dipper played her music.<br />
    She spun around and sang.<br />
    “What will you do, Jeb?” Eddy asked.<br />
    “Watch this!” Jeb said.<br />
    Jeb rolled to the dirt area.<br />
    He lifted a big rock.<br />
    “Wow!” everyone said.<br />
    “I will lift big things,” Jeb said.<br />
    “I can tell jokes,” Poppy said.<br />
    “And I can do balloon tricks!”<br />
    Poppy’s trunk popped open.<br />
    Balloons floated out.<br />
    “Cool!” Gasser said.<br />
    “I will drive over things.”<br />
    Brumm, brumm!<br />
    Gasser drove over a dirt pile.<br />
    “What will you do, Eddy?” Jeb asked.<br />
    Eddy frowned. “I don’t know.”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 70: Dipper’s Music Player<br />
    “This stinks,” Eddy said.<br />
    “I don’t have a talent!”<br />
    “Don’t be silly,” Poppy said.<br />
    “Think, Eddy,” Dipper said.<br />
    “What do you love to do?”<br />
    “I like to go fast,” Eddy said.<br />
    Just then Zippy drove over.<br />
    Zippy laughed. “You’re slow.”<br />
    “Going fast is not your talent!”<br />
    Zippy sped off.<br />
    “Grr!” Eddy zoomed after Zippy.<br />
    They raced around the parking lot.<br />
    Then they zoomed back.<br />
    Eddy skidded.<br />
    “Oh no!” Dipper cried.<br />
    Crash!<br />
    Eddy banged into Dipper.<br />
    “Oof!” Dipper cried.<br />
    “Sorry!” Eddy said.<br />
    “Are you okay?”<br />
    “I think so,” Dipper said.<br />
    She tried to play her music.<br />
    But no sound came out.<br />
    Dipper gulped.<br />
    “My music player broke!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 71: A New Music Player<br />
    “This stinks!” Dipper said.<br />
    “We’re having a talent show.<br />
    I need my music player!”<br />
    “Let’s check my junkyard,” Gasser said.<br />
    “Maybe we can find one there.”<br />
    The friends searched the junkyard.<br />
    Gasser found a music player.<br />
    “Thank you!” Dipper said.<br />
    “I’ll put it in later.<br />
    Eddy, can you carry it?”<br />
    Eddy nodded.<br />
    Jeb lifted the music player.<br />
    He put it in Eddy’s dumper.<br />
    Suddenly Jeb bumped a tire pile.<br />
    One tire bounced onto Poppy.<br />
    “Ouch!” Poppy said.<br />
    Her hood got dented.<br />
    “Sorry!” Jeb said.<br />
    Gasser found Poppy a new hood.<br />
    Jeb lifted the hood.<br />
    He placed it in Eddy’s dumper.<br />
    Jeb looked at the hood.<br />
    It balanced on the music player.<br />
    Jeb told Eddy.<br />
    Eddy grinned.<br />
    “I have an idea, Jeb!” he said.<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 72: The Talent Show<br />
    “Good morning,” Ms. Fender said.<br />
    “It’s time for the talent show!”<br />
    Dipper spun around in circles.<br />
    Her music filled the air.<br />
    Zippy zoomed across the parking lot.<br />
    “Watch me!” he said.<br />
    Gasser drove over dirt piles.<br />
    Poppy told jokes.<br />
    She did balloon tricks.<br />
    Jeb looked at Eddy.<br />
    “It’s our turn now,” Jeb said.<br />
    Jeb lifted a big rock.<br />
    He tossed it through the air.<br />
    Everyone gasped.<br />
    Eddy spun around and—<br />
    Bang!<br />
    The rock landed in Eddy’s dumper.<br />
    “Got it!” Eddy said.<br />
    “Yay!” everyone cheered.<br />
    Jeb tossed another rock.<br />
    Eddy moved fast.<br />
    Crunch!<br />
    He caught the rock.<br />
    The rock landed on the first rock!<br />
    Jeb threw more rocks.<br />
    Soon Eddy balanced six rocks.<br />
    Everyone cheered.<br />
    Eddy and Jeb grinned.<br />
