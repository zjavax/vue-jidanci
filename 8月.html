Going Green
I decided to try to make some money during the summer
holidays. I took our lawn mower and went around our
neighbourhood asking if anyone wanted their grass cut.
Our lawn mower was very old. It wasn’t electric or gas-
powered. It was called “pushing power” because you had
to push it to make the cutting blades move. It was a lot of
hard work.
I put a little sign on the mower saying Charlie’s Lawn
Cutting. After working for a few weeks, I soon had regular
customers. Within about a month, I had enough money to
buy a gas-powered mower. I thought, “Now I can do the
work faster and make more money!”
The first time I brought my new gas-powered lawn mower
to cut a neighbour’s lawn, the lady came to the door and
said, “What’s that?” I told her it was my new lawn mower
and that it would do a better job than the old push mower.
She looked disappointed and said, “You mean you got rid
of that old push mower?” I explained that it was such hard
work using a human-powered mower, and now I could
make more money.
The lady said, “You know, one of the reasons I gave you
the job was because of that old lawn mower. It doesn’t
pollute and it doesn’t make a big noise. I’m sure it’s hard
work, but it’s great exercise for you, isn’t it?”
Then she said, “I’ll let you cut my grass if you use that old
mower, but not that gas-powered one.” I was shocked. “I’ll
have to come back later with the old one,” I told her.
I went to the next house and the same thing happened.
People liked the fact that I was using good old-fashioned
human power instead of gasoline power.
I took the gas mower back to the store that day. Now I use
my old push mower and I wear a T-shirt that says:
Charlie’s Lawn Cutting. No noise, no pollution -- just
me!

A Pool of Their Own
My cousins were raised in a well-off family. We loved to go
to their house because it was so big and fancy. Best of all,
it had a beautiful swimming pool. It was shaped like a big
“L” and had a diving board.
One thing that always impressed me about my cousins
was that they didn’t think they were better than anyone
else, even though they were rich. The reason was that my
Uncle John and Aunt Kate made sure they were not
spoiled with gifts. The pool was a perfect example of this.
One day in the summer, my cousins were bored and hot,
so they said to my Uncle John, “Dad, we’re the only kids in
this neighbourhood that don’t have a pool. Can we have
one?”
“Of course you can!” agreed their father. “A pool it is! It will
be started tomorrow.” The kids were amazed to see how
agreeable their dad was.
Early the next day, my uncle woke up everyone and
brought them downstairs. “Come on outside. I have a
surprise for you!” he said. “Close your eyes.” They did,
and he led them to the backyard. “Now hold out your
hands,” he said. When they opened their eyes, each of
them had been presented with a new shovel.
A look of shock came over their faces. Then, their dad said
with a smile, “You can have a pool, but you’re going to
have to dig it!”
At first, the digging went slowly. They were exhausted
every day. But as the week passed, they began to see
their work take shape. Within ten days, they had the pool
completely dug out. Then, the construction workers came
and poured the cement. In another week, they had a
finished pool. And best of all, they had helped make it.
They were so proud!
Years later, my cousin said to me, “I never asked my dad if
I could borrow the car because I was afraid I’d have to
build it myself!”
They had many blessings in their lives, but the biggest by
far was having very smart parents.

Weather According to Bugs
In modern times, we get our weather report scientifically.
People known as “meteorologists” use information from
satellites in outer space to tell us what the weather will be
like. They make predictions about the weather for today,
tomorrow and even for entire season. Will it rain? Will it
snow? Will it be hot or will it be a long and harsh winter?
But what did people do before modern technology? Well,
not so long ago, people lived much closer to nature. Using
the power of observation, humans made predictions about
the weather based on what was happening in the insect
world. Sometimes their predictions were accurate, and
sometimes they weren’t.
My grandfather spent his whole life as a farmer in rural
Canada. He is long gone now. But I still remember his
stories about how to predict the weather. For example, in
summer, he would often stop to observe the anthills --
those little sandy mounds at the entrance to an ant colony.
“Look closely at the anthills in July.” Grandpa used to say.
“If the anthills are high in July, expect a snowy winter.” Of
course, as a kid, I believed my grandfather. But you know
what? The anthills are often correct. Not always, but often
enough to make me a believer.
In September, Grandpa would often point out a small
insect curled up somewhere in a sunny location. “That’s a
woolly caterpillar,” he would say. “Observe the orange
band around its belly. If it’s wide and full, we’re sure to
have a mild and easy winter. If it’s thin, watch out! The
winter will be severe.”
I am older now. I get my weather mostly from the
television or radio. Scientists rarely get it wrong. After all,
they have the latest scientific instruments to help them.
But I still stop to observe the anthills in July, and of course,
the woolly caterpillars in the fall. The older generation can
teach us many things. My grandfather was not a
meteorologist, but he knew a thing or two about insects
and the weather.

The Boy Who Forgot to Be a Boy
Tom has always lived for ideas. Books and ideas have
always fascinated him. Why should he care about people?
They only made fun of him. They were jealous because he
was so smart, or so he thought.
It seemed that Tom knew everything -- except one small
detail. He didn’t know how to get along with other people.
He convinced his parents that school was a waste of time,
so he began home schooling with special teachers. He
dreamed of being the youngest person to enter university,
and he sent letters to professors to see if it was possible.
One day, the doorbell rang. When Tom opened the door,
there was his idol -- Professor Rosen. Tom was so excited
that he almost fainted. The two talked for a long time,
exchanging ideas. The professor was amazed at what this
young boy knew. “Tom, tell me about your friends. What
do you do for fun?” the professor wanted to know.
There was silence as Tom realized that he didn’t really
have any friends. “Well, I don’t have time for all that. I’m
too busy with my studies,” he said.
“That’s a problem, Tom. You have to learn that the world is
not just filled with ideas. It’s filled with people. And you
have to remember to be what you are... a boy. Boys need
to have fun.”
The professor talked a bit more and then said, “I have to
go, but I have a test for you. In this box, there are three
objects. I want you to learn how to use them. It’s very
complicated and you’ll need another person to help you.
Experiment and learn how to use them, and I’ll be back in
a week to see how you’re doing. Then, I’ll have another
test for you.”
The professor left and Tom opened the box. Inside were
two baseball gloves and a ball.

Ants: Social Insects
Ants are small and fascinating insects. Spend some time
observing how ants organize their societies, and you’ll
agree that they can teach us a thing or two.
They’ve existed for at least 100 million years. You can find
them everywhere except very cold regions. There are
more than 20,000 species in the ant family.
Physically, ants are divided into three main sections: head,
trunk and rear. They have antennae on their heads for
touch, smell, taste and hearing. Their jaws open like
scissors and are very strong. Ants breathe through holes
in their bodies. Their bodies are covered in a tough
armour-like material for protection.
As with all insects, ants have six strong legs that allow
them to run at high speeds. Some ants can carry 50 times
their body weight.
Ants are small social insects. They live in organized
communities called colonies. In a colony, there are worker
ants, which cannot produce offspring, and queen ants,
which lay eggs. Ants live for about two months. They go
through four stages of life: egg, larva, pupa, and adult.
They build homes and store food for rainy days. They
never seem to stop working. Above all, they take care of
each other. Everything works without much supervision.
Worker ants have specific jobs. Some find food. Others
look after the younger ants. Some workers defend the
nest, while others are responsible for keeping the nest
tidy. Ants in a community recognize each other using
touch and smell. When they meet, they put their antennae
together as a way of recognizing and greeting each other.
Everything, especially food, is shared in the colony. When
ants find a really rich source of food, they leave a scent
trail so that other workers will find it too.
The way ants regulate traffic on a busy food trail
demonstrates their intelligence. Ants heading out to gather
food are light and can travel fast. But those returning are
carrying a heavy load and slow. This would create a traffic
jam, but ants have a solution. They divide the trail into
lanes. The fast-moving ants use two outside lanes while
the slow-moving ants use the centre lane.
Observe an ant colony if you want to see a well-organized
community in action.

Not Just Another Party
Jason was reading the newspaper. There were several
articles about the recent earthquake near the Pakistan-
India border. The massive earthquake caused severe
damage.
Villages were reduced to rubble, landslides were triggered,
and apartment buildings collapsed. The death toll had
already reached 40,000. As many as five million people
were homeless and living in freezing temperatures.
Countries all over the world were pitching in to help with
the disaster relief.
For Jason, the earthquake disaster was an incident that hit
close to his heart. His family had emigrated from India just
a few years earlier. When he saw the effects of the
earthquake, he knew he had to do something. His heart
ached for the victims of the earthquake and for the
survivors.
After a sleepless night, Jason came up with an idea. He
was going to host a benefit dinner to raise funds for the
earthquake disaster relief. It would not be an easy task.
The Indian community in Jason’s college town was small,
but he was sure there was wide concern for the victims.
Jason approached the owners of the small Indian
restaurant where he worked part time. They immediately
agreed to support him. So Jason began to plan the event.
Luckily, his friends were more than willing to pitch in.
Jason and a pal from his math class designed the
invitation. Then, they brought it to a stationery store that
had agreed to print the invitations for free. The invitations
were mailed out. Jason and his friends spent hours
hanging up posters all around the city. They followed up
the invitations by calling local politicians, business leaders,
and anyone else who would listen to them.
Finally, after a whirlwind few days of planning, the big
night arrived. People showed great generosity. The gala
raised a lot of money. In addition to the money raised by
the dinner itself, many guests brought their chequebooks
to make an additional donation to the cause.
When it was all over, Jason and his friends counted the
money. It was twice what they had originally expected.

A Special Dream (I)
Nancy is my mom’s best friend. At the age of 43, she took
a step that many people her age would never even
consider taking. She registered for a hairdresser-training
course.
It wasn’t easy when she first stepped into the classroom.
Her classmates were young, energetic. Nancy, on the
other hand, was as old as their mothers. Even more
remarkable, she had just recovered from thyroid surgery.
Ten years ago, Nancy developed high thyroid levels. Her
health became a great obstacle to what she wanted to do.
What is a thyroid? A thyroid is a small gland in the human
body that plays a critical role in human health. It makes
and stores hormones that help regulate heart rate, blood
pressure, body temperature, and the rate at which food is
converted into energy. Needless to say, life is difficult if
you have high thyroid levels.
Over many years, Nancy took medicine and tried to
control her condition. After a long struggle, she decided to
have surgery to remove the thyroid.
Although the surgery is not as complicated as an open-
chest operation, it’s quite tricky. The human body is very
sophisticated. The thyroid is located in the neck, close to
quite a few nerves. Damage to any of these nerves could
cause patients to lose their voice or result in significant
impairment of swallowing and respiratory functions.
Before the operation, the doctor told her that anything
could happen. She signed the consent form anyway. While
she was on the operating table, Nancy thought about her
life. One of her thoughts was to pursue her dreams if she
regained her health.
For many years, she had dreamed about becoming a
hairdresser. She felt that it was magic when people went
in with a head of hair like a haystack, and left with a
gorgeous new look.
Nancy’s operation was successful. As she recovered in
the hospital, she decided to make the changes she had
promised herself.
Soon, she began her journey to become a professional
hairdresser.

A Special Dream (II)
When Nancy registered to train as a hairdresser, she was
determined to be the best hairdresser in town. After all,
she wanted to live her dream, and there was no way she
could do that half-heartedly.
She attended class with students half her age. In one way,
she was the same as everyone else. She sat in the class,
listened to instructors and practised the basic skills.
But, Nancy was not quite the same as the others. Each
day, she was the first to arrive and the last to leave. At
first, she was overwhelmed by the numerous haircut
styles, hair treatment methods and tools. She had to
master a lot of physics and chemistry. She even had to
learn about biology!
Nancy absorbed everything like a sponge during this six-
month training. At the end of the class, she became one of
the few all-star hairdressers, an award given only to the
best students.
Nancy graduated from her training course and landed her
first job in a salon that belonged to the school owner.
Customers paid half the regular price because most of the
hairdressers were new grads and most of the customers
were seniors.
Nancy wanted to do a good job. She said she would be
happy only when all her customers were satisfied.
Being a hairdresser was not as easy as she thought.
Standing for seven or eight hours every day was both a
physical, and a mental challenge. Think about it. You have
to stand all day, and you have to lift your arms that long
too. At her age, the challenge was tremendous.
The first day after work, Nancy went straight to bed for an
hour. She was exhausted. Her day was really long and
tiring. However, when she thought of the smiles on her
customers’ faces, she knew she had made the right
decision.
A year later, she moved to a professional hair studio, and
her loyal customers followed her. They said that Nancy
was doing haircuts with her heart, not just with her hands.
She was the most popular hairdresser in the city. It just
goes to show that it’s never too late to start living your
dreams.

Rainbow After the Flood
(adapted from a Bible story)
After it rains, the sky sometimes lights up with a beautiful
bow of many colours. Have you seen this wonder in the
sky? It’s a rainbow.
Rainbows seem magical. People everywhere have stories
and legends about what they are. Here is one story about
rainbows and where they come from.
Do you know the story about Noah and the great flood?
The creator was angry with his people. He decided to
make it rain for forty days and forty nights. He wanted to
drown all the people except Noah and his family.
When the water left the earth, Noah and his family came
out of their boat and began to populate the land once
again.
After the flood, many were fearful that the creator would
bring another flood of destruction. The creator, being wise
and kind, made a promise to the people. He promised
never again to destroy the earth with a flood.
As a sign to the people so they would not be afraid, the
creator made rainbows. “Now, when it rains and the
clouds cover the sky, do not be afraid, for I will make a
rainbow,” he said. “The rainbow will remind me of my
promise. It will remind me that I must never flood the earth
again.”
And so, the people were happy. They worked hard and
their families grew. From time to time, a great rain would
begin. Trusting their creator, the people were not afraid.
They looked to the sky, searching for the bow of many
colours.
Whenever a rainbow appeared, they gave thanks, for they
knew that their creator had kept his word. They knew that
he would never destroy the earth with water again. And so
it has always been.
Look into the sky next time it rains. See if you can find a
rainbow.

A Boat Ride
While vacationing last summer, my brother and I were out
in the middle of the lake on our rowboat, having a great
time. We were about one kilometre away from our
campsite when the wind picked up and bad weather rolled
in.
“Hurry up!” my brother called. “Let’s get out of here before
the storm hits.” We started to row back to the shore. But
we soon found that the wind was very strong, and we
were moving slowly. One kilometre seemed a long way to
go.
Over the treetops where our camp was, we saw clusters of
clouds floating above. They weren’t ordinary clouds. They
were very dark. “It’s going to be a terrible storm,” shouted
my brother. We rowed as hard as we could, but it seemed
we were getting nowhere.
The winds were raging now. There was a strange green
colour in the clouds as they raced angrily above us. Try as
we might, we could make no headway against the
powerful force. Just then, my brother came up with a good
idea.
Since we obviously couldn’t make it back to shore against
the wind, we could simply go with the wind and let it push
our boat to the other shore.
We turned the boat around and began to row as fast as
we could. The little rowboat had never travelled so fast!
Although the other shore was also about a kilometre away,
we covered the distance in no time, thanks to the powerful
wind pushing us. We reached the shore and stood there,
watching the sky.
It was then that I saw the scariest thing ever. From the sky
came a long stream of cloud, shaped like a funnel. We
realized that we were seeing a tornado!
We watched the tornado touch down and sweep across
our campsite. If we had made it back to the camp, who
knows what would have happened to us!
Our site was ruined, but we weren’t hurt. We were very
lucky. I learned about the incredible power of nature that
day. It’s something that I will never forget.
8-11
Discovering the Night Sky
For one night each month, King’s University shares its
telescope with kids from all over the city. It’s a chance for
them to get an up-close look at the wonders of the night
sky.
Professor Jones, supervisor of the Telescopes for Kids
program, says that when youngsters take their first look
through a telescope, they’re hooked for life. “The night sky
is an awesome thing to discover,” says Professor Jones.
“Most kids look up and see only stars. But there is a whole
lot more going on up there.”
Professor Jones begins each star-viewing session by
explaining that the earth’s sun is just a star. “If you were
on a distant planet looking at our sun from a telescope, it
would look just like any other star. The sun is the centre of
our solar system, but it’s just one of billions of stars in our
galaxy – the Milky Way.
The professor often hears gasps of disbelief from the kids
when he tells them that the Milky Way contains more than
200 billion stars! The kids are even more amazed to learn
that our galaxy is travelling through space at a speed of
about 250 kilometres per second.
“There are so many stars in the Milky Way that it’s
impossible to see individual stars. You see only a long
band of white light. It looks like someone spilled a glass of
milk across the sky,” says Professor Jones. “That’s why it’s
called the Milky Way.”
Thirteen-year-old Anne Wilson has been visiting the sky
observatory for a couple of years. “I used to look up at the
sky and see the stars and the moon,” says Anne. “But I
didn’t really know anything about them. Now that I have
learned to identify some of the main constellations and the
brightest stars in the heavens, I’ve begun to appreciate
how vast the universe really is.”
That’s the way it is with the universe. It’s so large that it’s
difficult to understand it. As Professor Jones explains,
“Sometimes we all get caught up in ourselves. We think
that we are the centre of the universe. Learning about the
night sky helps us keep things in perspective.”

Antique Collector
Mr. Joe recently became interested in antiques. Maybe it’s
because of the numerous TV antique shows, or maybe it’s
because someone sold an ancient vase for more than one
hundred thousand dollars. No matter what, Mr. Joe
became obsessed with the idea of becoming a private
collector. He dreamed of finding a rare piece one day --
maybe a vase or a painting sitting out of view somewhere.
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single
step -- that’s Mr. Joe’s motto. So, starting one Saturday,
he decided to set out on a trip to visit small-town antique
shops along Highway 117. He stopped whenever he saw a
sign that said ANTIQUES.
Mr. Joe was excited as he searched for the treasure he
felt he was sure to find. There were so many items in each
of the places he visited -- European miniature statues,
First Nation crafts, Chinese porcelains, paintings, teapots
and even some Indian vases. He didn’t know which ones
to pick. As a novice collector, he was interested in all of
them.
Finally, he bought an Indian vase, a Chinese tea set, a
European painting and some Canadian sculptures.
It was a happy journey. He couldn’t wait to get home and
invite his friends to share the joy of his collection. Among
his friends, one had been collecting antiques for years.
When he looked at Joe’s treasures, he laughed and told
Joe that five out of six of his items were new. They were
not antiques!
He then explained that a collector must have knowledge of
history, art, and much more. It’s the right knowledge and a
pair of keen eyes that make you an antique collector.
Moreover, each piece in a collection has a story behind it.
It’s never like the experience of shopping at a mall.
Joe was a bit embarrassed when he heard the comments.
Nevertheless, it was a good start. Joe was determined to
gain more knowledge and continue his explorations. He
still hopes to find the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.

Eagle Eye
Jimmy was known as “Eagle Eye”. He was a champion
archer. An archer is a person who shoots targets with a
bow and arrow. No one in his school had better aim or
better eyesight than Jimmy.
When school started after the summer vacation, Jimmy
joined the archery team again. He shot his first arrow of
the season, but it did not hit the target. “No problem,” he
said. “I just had something in my eye. I’ll get it this time.”
He tried again and missed... again. Jimmy had never
missed before. Someone said, “Hey Jimmy, I think you
need glasses!” Everyone laughed because they all knew
what good eyesight Jimmy had.
After class, the gym teacher spoke with Jimmy. “You know,
Jimmy, you should get your eyes checked. You may
actually need glasses. A lot of great athletes wear glasses
or contact lenses.” But Jimmy insisted that he was fine.
Over the next few weeks, Jimmy played more sports, but
he was not the same as before. He missed shots that he
would never have missed before. The gym teacher was
always watching. Finally, he approached Jimmy and said,
“Come with me.” He took Jimmy to the nurse’s office.
There was an eye chart on the wall. Jimmy read the top
line and the second line perfectly. But when he attempted
to read the third line, he began to struggle and got one of
the letters wrong.
The nurse smiled and said, “Jimmy, there’s nothing wrong
with your eyes. You just need glasses.”
“Glasses?” Jimmy said. “How terrible!”
Jimmy got his glasses. At first, he felt a little strange
wearing them. But when he went to archery practice, he
made perfect shot after perfect shot. The class applauded
because the old Jimmy was back.
Now, Jimmy wears special sports glasses, and he’s back
to being the best athlete in the school. He looks pretty cool
in his glasses. And everyone still calls him “Eagle Eye”.

The Fish That Got Away
(inspired by a traditional story)
My Aunt Sara is known in our family as a wise woman. If
you have a problem, you can always turn to her for advice.
Sometimes she tells a little story to demonstrate her point.
I’m the type of person who acts without thinking things
through. I have a care-free attitude. I just take things as
they come and hope for the best. That’s the way it was
when I was looking for a summer job this year. I wanted to
make some money so that I would be able to buy things
when school started in the fall.
Well, it was a pretty busy spring. With soccer and long
nights playing outside with friends, by the time I got
around to applying for any student jobs, they were all
taken. That left me as one of the few kids with no summer
job. What a terrible summer it was! My friends had jobs
and money to buy things with. But me, I’d left it too late.
My summer ended up being long and boring.
Aunt Sara told me a story. It was simple, but it made me
think about my care-free attitude.
There were three fish living in a small river. Their names
were Make Plans, Fast Thinker, and Wait and See.
One day, they heard a fisherman saying that he would
cast a net into the lake in the morning. Make Plans was
not worried. He immediately decided to swim upriver so as
not to be caught. Fast Thinker was not worried. “Surely, I
will have a plan by the time the man casts his net,” he said
to himself. Wait and See was not worried either. “I will
decide what to do in the morning,” he said.
In the morning, the fisherman cast his net. By this time,
Make Plans was far away, but the other two fish were
caught. Fast Thinker rolled over on his back and
pretended to be dead. Of course, the fisherman did not
want dead fish, so he threw Fast Thinker back into the
river.
But Wait and See was caught and sold that evening at the
local market.

Tea: The Drink Known Around the World
Water is the world’s most popular drink. However, tea is a
close second. It is consumed by people all over the world,
and it easily outsells the other two popular drinks – coffee
and cocoa.
Consumed in almost every country, tea inspires rituals and
brings friends closer. From its accidental beginnings in
China nearly 5,000 years ago, this amazing versatile hot
drink has travelled around the world.
Accepted folklore has it that the Chinese Emperor Shen
Nung discovered tea by accident in 2737 BC. One
morning, as he was walking in his garden, a small leaf
drifted down from a tea tree and fell into his drinking bowl.
The Emperor took a sip from his bowl and the rest, as they
say, is history.
Early on, Japanese monks visiting China developed a
fondness for tea. They brought it back to Japan where it
soon gained a place in the social customs of the time. The
Japanese did not immediately begin to grow their own tea.
Instead, they relied on imports from China. However, by
the 12th century, tea was being cultivated in Japan.
The Chinese ambassador to Russia gave the Russians
their first taste of tea in the early 1600s. But it wasn’t until
the end of that century that a booming tea trade was
established between the two nations.
By the middle of the17th century, tea had become popular
in Europe. Initially, it was treated as a medicinal drink. It
was thought to be good for poor digestion and for calming
the nerves.
A pivotal moment in the history of tea in the West occurred
in 1662, with the marriage of a Portuguese princess to the
King of England. Although tea was already being
consumed in small quantities in England, it was not until
Princess Catherine came to England with her love of tea
that things really began to take off. For the next 300 years,
tea and high society were linked.
Tea has come of age since that fateful morning when
Emperor Shen Nung first tasted it. There was no way he
could have known how his warm drink would travel to
distant lands in the coming centuries.

Visit to a Dentist
Did you know that nearly everyone hates going to the
dentist? Some people say they would rather walk a mile
across hot coals than spend a few minutes in a dentist’s
chair. I am no different. I do not like visiting the dentist at
all.
As a child, I took care of my teeth and brushed them twice
a day. However, when I grew up, I could not avoid the
dentist. It all started with my wisdom teeth. These teeth
grow at the back of your mouth, after your other teeth
have been there for many years.
I was twenty years old when two wisdom teeth began to
surface slowly. Not long after, I developed a hole in the
right wisdom tooth, which led to infections once in a while.
I visited a dentist, who suggested that I have it pulled out.
A week later, I went to the dental clinic to have the wisdom
tooth removed. I was nervous, but the nurse assured me
that it wouldn’t hurt because they would give me
something for the pain.
First, a nurse jabbed my gums with a needle full of
anaesthetic to kill the pain. Soon, my right cheek, my lip
and my tongue became numb.
While waiting, I listened to the clink-clank of the dentist
tools being prepared. The sounds made me nervous.
Soon, the dentist came and asked me to open my mouth
wide so he could prepare the tooth for extraction. He
tested my numbness by poking here and there. Satisfied,
he began the surgery.
The dentist inserted various instruments into my mouth.
There was some shaking as a drill was used to grind the
tooth. The anaesthetic killed the pain, but I could still hear
the sound of the tools and feel the vibrations of the
instruments as they worked.
The time for the last step finally arrived. The nurse held
my head as the dentist tugged to pull out the wisdom
tooth. “One, two, three!” A few hard tugs and it came out.
It was done! With a cotton gauze in my cheek, I gestured
to the dentist with my thumb up. My friend came to drive
me home, and I was happy. It was all over!

Dad’s Old Car
Joshua was a rich man who came from a very poor family.
The only thing that his father was able to give him when
he died was his old car. Joshua kept the old car in the
garage, but he never looked at it. He kept it under a cover.
He was far more interested in his own new cars. The first
car was fast and beautiful. He never drove it in the rain.
The second car was a huge SUV. He bragged to his
friends that he didn’t care that it used so much fuel. He
was so rich that he could afford it! He also had an
expensive motorcycle.
One day, his wife suddenly became sick. She was so sick
that he needed to get her from his mansion in the woods
to the hospital as soon as possible.
He called the ambulance, but there was only one
ambulance where they lived. It was an hour away. He
couldn’t wait that long. “I’ll take my fastest car,” he
thought. But then he realized he couldn’t because it was
snowing hard. “I’ll drive the SUV,” he decided. “It can drive
through anything!” However, there was hardly any gas in
it, and the gas station was closed.
He looked over at the motorcycle and knew it was no use
in the snowstorm. Despite all his money and nice cars,
Joshua could not help his wife!
Suddenly, he remembered his father’s old car. He got in
and turned the key. It cranked and cranked. Finally, after
years of sitting in the garage, the old car sputtered to life!
They made it to the hospital, and his wife was saved.
The old rusty car served him better than all the expensive
cars he had. The next day, Joshua sold his expensive
cars. He fixed up his father’s old car and made it look like
new. He then bought the hospital another ambulance.
Now, Joshua proudly drives his dad’s old car every day!

The Turtle Who Talked Too Much
(based on a traditional Indian legend)
Long ago, there was a turtle who really liked to talk. He
was known in his neighbourhood as the talkative turtle.
You could always find him pronouncing his views on any
subject. He always had an opinion and was always certain
that he was correct. That was why he insisted on talking
so much.
In his mind, he believed that others truly wanted to hear
what he had to say.
In reality, they whispered behind his back, calling him an
“old windbag”, and a “talking machine”. The turtle went on
and on, spending his days telling others how clever he
was. He even went so far as to state that he was the
cleverest of all the animals in the jungle.
One day, this turtle heard some hunters saying that they
were going to catch some turtles. The market for turtles
was good that year, and this was an ideal place to make
some money.
The turtle knew that he must make a run for it, for he did
not want to end up in a pot of turtle soup. He asked two
cranes to help him escape. His plan was simple. He
instructed the two birds to hold a stick between their
mouths. “I will hold on to this stick with my teeth, and you
shall fly with me to safety, far from these horrid turtle
hunters.”
The birds agreed. They warned the turtle to keep his
mouth closed tightly so that he could hold on to the stick.
The plan worked like magic.
The birds flew high over the jungle with the turtle hanging
from the stick, his mouth clamped around it tightly. From
below, the other animals looked up in amazement. “Those
birds are really smart to think of such a way to carry a
turtle,” they said.
Upon hearing this, the turtle opened his mouth, letting go
of the stick, and shouted, “But it was I who thought of this
plan!” And with that, the turtle fell to the land below.

Homing Pigeons Deliver
Today, communicating with people is easy. No matter
where you live in the world, you can type an e-mail and hit
the SEND button.
But how did we send messages to people before
electricity, telephones, and even regular post office mail?
There were many ways, of course, but each took a long
time. You could, for example, send your messages with
someone who was travelling by land or ship to the distant
place where you needed to deliver your messages.
But there were times when the message was urgent --
when taking days, weeks or even months would not do.
That’s where an amazing little bird entered the picture.
The messenger pigeon is a special kind of bird with a
natural ability to find its way home. That’s why it’s
sometimes called a “homing pigeon”. Scientists have
studied these unique birds for many years. They want to
understand how the birds can be taken hundreds, even
thousands of miles away from their homes, and still find
their way back to where they were released.
There are many theories. Some speculate that the birds
recognize the land below them. Others believe they know
how to use the sun to guide them in the right direction.
And still, others feel that the birds know how to use the
earth’s magnetic field as a special compass.
No matter how they did it, homing pigeons were the best
and fastest way to send messages long ago. They were
used all over the world to help people send their
messages out. The way it worked was simple.
Let’s say a general in a war wanted to make sure that he
could communicate quickly with his soldiers on the battle
field. Pigeons raised at his location were taken by his
soldiers to the battle field. When the soldiers had an
urgent message for the general, they would write it on a
thin sheet of paper and attach it to the pigeon’s leg. Then,
they would release the bird, and it would head home
where the general was.
It might seem strange to those of us who use e-mail today.
But it wasn’t long ago when this little grey bird with a
special talent to find its way home was the best way to
send urgent messages.

Working on the Roof
My summer job was to help my dad as a roofer. It’s very
hard work, and it’s very hot. Sometimes it can reach nearly
60°C on the roof! But no matter how hot it is, you have to
go up and do the job.
The good thing is that you get paid really well. By the end
of the summer, I was going to have big savings in my
account for university.
We started in the spring. I worked with Dad on the
weekends. It wasn’t too hot then. But when June arrived, it
got hotter and hotter each day. My father told me that the
most important thing was to keep drinking water. If you
didn’t, you would get dehydrated. You wouldn’t even have
enough water left to sweat. And you could even die.
Dad said, “You’re responsible for your own water, and
don’t take anyone else’s water.”
One day, it was incredibly hot. It was about 25°C by 7:00
a.m. We started work, but when I went over to get my
water, it wasn’t there. I had forgotten it. I was embarrassed
and mad at myself. I remembered my dad’s words about
not taking anyone else’s water, so I continued working. It
kept getting hotter. Soon, I wasn’t feeling very well.
The next thing I remember was waking up in the hospital
with my mother looking at me with a very worried look. I
had a terrible headache. Worse than that, I looked down
and saw that my leg was in a cast. I had broken my leg!
The doctor told me that I had fainted and fallen off the
roof. Luckily, I landed in a large bush below.
My days as a roofer were over. My dad was mad that I
had not asked for his water. But I told him, “You said not to
take anyone else’s water.”
He smiled and said, “I meant don’t steal anybody’s water,
but you can ask for it!”
Now he tells me!

A Secret World
I love doing projects with my dad. We have installed a new
sink in the kitchen, built a new room, and painted the
house. I always learn a lot when we do projects together.
So when my dad told me that he needed my help to drill a
hole through a wall, I said, “Sure.”
We had to drill through a piece of wood that was about 8
feet long by 8 feet high.
Dad told me to do the drilling. So I put the drill against the
wood near the floor, pressed the START button, and
slowly pushed the drill into the wood.
In no time at all, I had pushed the drill through the wall. My
dad went around to the other side of the wall to see where
the drill had come through. It hadn’t. “Did you drill as far as
it could go?” he called.
“Yes!” I yelled back.
I pulled the drill out. To our surprise, there was something
stuck to it. My dad looked at it. “It’s paper,” he said.
He used a flashlight to look inside the hole. There was a
book inside the wall!
Dad removed the entire piece of wood, and behind it was
a wall of books! There were hundreds of books. We called
the rest of the family so they could see this wonderful
discovery. There were books from 100 years ago about
everything you could imagine. There were books about
science, sports, people and countries.
That day, we discovered a secret world right in our own
house. We have learned so much from these books, but
there is one thing we have not learned -- who put those
books there and why?
I’d really like to know, but my mom says that not knowing
is the best part. Maybe she’s right.

Cotton: A Valued Plant for Thousands of Years
Humans have been using cotton to make fabric for
clothing for more than 7,000 years. The ancient Egyptians
produced it. So did the Incas of Peru and the ancient
Persians.
Today, it remains the most commonly used natural
material in the entire world. You might not be aware of it,
but in your everyday life, you come in contact with cotton
everywhere.
When you wake up in the morning, chances are that you
slept on bedsheets made of cotton. You take a shower
and when you dry yourself, you probably use a towel
made of cotton. You put on your clothes, which probably
have at least some cotton in them. In fact, until 1890,
when the first synthetic fabric (rayon) was developed,
most clothing was made of cotton.
Cotton has many properties that make it an excellent
clothing material. On hot days, cotton clothing feels cool. It
absorbs body sweat and draws it away from the skin,
keeping you cool and comfortable. Fish nets, filters,
surgical masks and even paper are made from cotton.
Cotton fabric is made from the cotton plant, a small plant
that’s easy to grow. The seeds of the cotton plant are
surrounded by fluffy white fibres for protection. These
fibres are collected and spun into cloth, which can then be
made into many products.
The cotton seeds are not wasted either. They are
squeezed in a machine that presses the oil out of them.
This oil is a valuable product for cooking and is used in
many foods. The mush that’s left is used to feed animals
such as pigs and cows.
Nothing is wasted. That’s why cotton is such an amazing
plant. Even more importantly, cotton is a natural product.
It doesn’t require a lot of energy to produce, and it can be
renewed every year simply by planting a new crop.
As the world searches for natural products for a
sustainable world, the simplicity of cotton production
assures its value well into the future.

The Tree and the Stingy Brother
(adapted from an English folk tale)
There once were two brothers who were as different as
night and day. One of them was a farmer. One day, he
decided to visit his brother who had an apple orchard near
the city. The fruit from his trees was as good and sweet as
any in the land.
The city brother dug up one of the fine trees from his
orchard and gave it to his brother as a gift. “I have
selected the best tree in my orchard,” he said. “Care for it
well, and it will provide apples for you and your children.”
When the farmer returned to the countryside, he could not
decide where to plant the apple tree.
He considered planting it on a nearby hillside where it
would get plenty of sun, and grow well. Then he thought,
“If I put it there, the high winds might blow the fruits off the
tree before I can harvest them. Also, the tree will be
exposed to the road, where all the travellers will be able to
see it. They will surely steal the fruit from me.”
Next, he thought about planting it in his front yard, by the
door. Again, he hesitated. He thought that children coming
and going would be tempted by the ripening fruit. “People
who come to my door will see it and steal the fruit,” he
thought. No, it would not do to put such a tree where
thieves could easily rob him.
Finally, the farmer decided to plant the tree far from his
house, behind a distant barn. The first year, he went each
day to look, but there was no fruit. The second and third
year, he still didn’t find any fruit on the tree.
He grew angry with his brother. He returned to the orchard
and accused his brother of giving him a tree that would not
bear fruit.
The city brother accompanied the farmer back to his farm.
He observed where the farmer had planted the tree. “You
are a fool, brother,” he said. “You chose a place where the
winds are cold, and where there is no sun to help the tree
make flowers and fruit. You planted this tree with greed
and mistrust. With such an attitude, you can expect
nothing from this tree!”

Wasting Time: Internet Addiction
There is an old belief that technology is neutral. It is
neither good nor bad -- it’s just a matter of how we apply it
in our everyday lives.
When the world’s newest technology, the World Wide
Web, first emerged, we believed that it was a force for
good. What could be wrong with easy access to
information right at your fingertips? However, as the
technology matures, some worrying developments cause
people to rethink some of their views about this new
technology.
The vast majority of people can surf the Web, find the
information they need, and then log off. It’s just another
tool -- like television, automobiles and cellphones. We use
it when we need it, and we leave it alone when we don’t.
However, for a growing percentage of people, especially
young people, the Internet has become an addiction.
It’s not easy to spot someone suffering from this
troublesome addiction. The image of a dishevelled
teenage boy, sitting in his dark room clicking away until the
early hours of the morning, is mostly a stereotype.
However, there are some common symptoms you can
look out for if you think that you, or any of your friends, are
heading to Internet addiction.
Instead of sleep, an addict chooses the computer. Instead
of real friends and family, this person prefers his online
pals. He often loses track of time. He basically lives in a
virtual world on the Internet.
He is tired all the time and gets upset easily if he can’t get
online. He refuses to obey his parents when asked him to
log off, and seems happy only when he is gaming online.
Addicts show big mood swings -- sometimes sad,
sometimes happy -- but they will never be satisfied unless
they are online.
If you spot any of these behaviours in yourself or your
friends, it’s time to stop and think things through.
Technology really is neutral. It’s only when you allow it to
take over your life that you are on dangerous ground.

Preserving Nature
My grandparents love nature. They enjoy hiking and
looking at birds, insects, and all the wildlife that shares the
planet with us. My grandparents own a beautiful farm with
fields, a forest and a little river flowing across it. They have
lived there all their lives.
Now that they are getting older, my grandparents are
thinking about the future of their farm. “It’s our duty to look
after this wonderful world,” my grandma always says. “We
should give nature a helping hand whenever we can.”
Grandpa definitely agrees. He loves his pond and
wetlands. “Not so long ago, everyone was getting rid of
wetlands,” Grandpa explained to me. “They didn’t know
what we know today about how wetlands work, and how
important they are to a healthy ecosystem. People thought
that they were yucky and unproductive. Nearly all the
wetlands were drained during those days.”
Luckily for us, Grandpa and Grandma did not drain the
wetlands on their property. If you take the time to look, you
will soon discover that wetlands are home to thousands of
creatures, big and small. An amazing number of plants,
animals and insects depend on wetlands for their survival.
Wetlands do other important things too, such as help
control water levels. When it rains, the wetlands soak up
the water, preventing big floods. They help with pollution
too. As polluted water flows through a wetland, much of
the pollution is filtered out of the water.
Grandpa and Grandma made a big decision a while ago.
They decided to preserve the wetlands on their farm as a
protected area. They contacted a non-profit group whose
mission was to help preserve wetlands for future
generations. If a landowner wants to save a wetland, this
group provides money and labour to help make it happen.
Grandpa and Grandma recently signed the agreement to
preserve their wetlands. Grandma says it makes her really
happy to know that long after she is gone, people will still
be able to enjoy the beauty of her “little piece of heaven”,
as she always calls it.

Water-- an Endless Cycle
Water is essential to life on earth. Next to air, it’s our most
important substance. It is, in fact, the source of life. Trees
need water. So do birds, insects, fish, grasses, flowers
and honeybees. All living things -- from the tiniest insects
to the tallest trees -- need water to survive.
Nearly 70 percent of the human body is water. We use it
for many internal processes including control of body
temperature, food digestion, nutrient transportation, and
waste removal. In fact, we can survive only a few days
without this life-giving substance.
Fortunately for us, there is nearly the same amount of
water on earth today as there was more than 100 million
years ago. Believe it or not, the water we drink today is
actually the very same water that people drank in the past.
How can that be?
Water is simply recycled in a process known as the water
cycle. Water is continuously moving and changing form as
it goes through the steps of this cycle: evaporation,
condensation, precipitation, and collection.
In a nutshell, here is how the water cycle works. First,
water is collected on the earth. Heat causes the water to
turn into vapour in a process called evaporation. Water
vapour then rises and condenses. Then it rains or snows,
which is called precipitation. Water falls back to earth
where it is collected, and the cycle starts over again.
In the natural environment, here is how the water cycle
functions. The sun warms up the water in lakes, rivers,
and oceans, turning it into vapour. This vapour begins to
rise. As the vapour rises, it cools and collects dust. Finally,
it forms clouds. Precipitation happens when the air gets
filled with too much condensed water. The clouds get
heavy and are unable to hold the water. That’s when it
rains or snows. As the precipitation reaches earth, it is
collected in lakes, rivers and in the ground. Soon, the
water cycle begins again, ensuring our survival.
It is really a remarkable process -- just one of many that
keep the delicate balance here on earth.

My Famous Dad
We have earthquakes where we live. They are frightening,
and they can do a lot of damage. Why do we live in a
place with earthquakes? Well, it’s very crowded in my
country, and all the flat land is taken for farming. So we
have to live on a mountainside.
While my father was building our new house, many asked
him why he was taking so long to build it. Normally, the
little houses people live in are built on pieces of wood
stuck into the ground. These houses are very weak and
can be built in a few days. But my dad was taking weeks
and weeks to build ours.
People laughed, but my father was a very serious man.
He took his time and was always looking for the right
materials. He studied how to make a house strong. Every
day, he would bring home pieces of wood or metal and put
them into the house in some way that would make it
stronger.
When the house was finally done, it did not look like our
neighbours’ houses. It had wood and steel bars all over it,
and the walls were very thick. It was embarrassing
because our house was so different from everyone else’s.
People made jokes.
As I said, we have terrible earthquakes in my area.
However, the last earthquake was three years ago. I was
beginning to forget them. Then one day, an earthquake hit.
The first jolt came when we were in the market. It was
scary. We could see the little huts on the mountain
collapsing.
After the earthquake, we ran up the mountainside to check
on our house. As we ran down the path, we saw that most
houses were damaged or had fallen down. But there was
our house, standing perfectly.
Luckily, no one was hurt in the earthquake. But everyone
came to look at our house. People who were laughing
before were now cheering for my father.
Now, everyone in our village builds better and stronger
houses thanks to my dad.

Plastic: A Modern Wonder
Plastic is lightweight, strong, and inexpensive. It’s one of
the most popular materials discovered in the last half of
the 20th century. Computers, modern automobiles,
packages, and containers of every kind -- these are just
some of the products that have improved since the
widespread use of plastic.
When it first gained popularity in the 1950s, plastic was
considered a “miracle invention”. The new product
promised to make life easier for the average person.
Newspapers talked about the wonders of plastic. People
marveled at the thousands of plastic products that soon hit
the market.
But what is plastic?
Plastic cannot be found in the natural environment. It is
made from hydrocarbons found in oil and natural gas. The
name for plastic comes from the Greek word plastikos,
which means “can be moulded into shapes”. This unique
quality of plastic gives it an advantage over other
materials.
Materials such as wood, steel, rubber and glass were
previously used to do the things that plastic now does.
However, none of these materials has the one property
that makes plastic so versatile. Plastic can be poured into
moulds while in a liquid state. When the liquid cools, it
keeps the shape of the mould. Think of any shape that’s
possible to make using plastic. Imagine the possibilities!
It’s strong, yet lightweight. Moreover, it’s waterproof and
weather resistant. That’s why many outdoor building
products are now made of plastic. Underground water
pipes do not rot if they’re made of plastic. Imagine the cost
savings with just this one small application.
Before plastic, steel water pipes were buried under the
earth. But the combination of steel and moist earth caused
rust. Steel pipes lasted only a short time in the earth
before they began to rot and leak. Plastic pipes, on the
other hand, can stay buried for hundreds of years with no
rust and no rot.
However, the easy access and wide use of plastic
products does raise an environmental concern. When
plastic is thrown out as garbage into the environment, it
takes at least fifty years to break down and degrade.
Whether we like it or not, plastic is here to stay. So do your
part and become plastic savvy.

I’m a Young Uncle
When I was fourteen years old, my cousin moved to the
United States with her husband and her 16-month-old son,
Daniel.
One day, we received a call from my cousin. After a brief
conversation, my cousin told me to listen to someone else
on the phone. I expected to talk to her husband. To my
surprise, it was a young voice on the other end.
“Uncle, Uncle,” said the voice. My mouth opened wide in
disbelief. “Is this Daniel calling me?” I asked. “Yes,” my
little nephew said from the other end of the line. Daniel
was talking! It brought back memories of a hospital visit.
Daniel was born prematurely, nearly four weeks earlier
than expected. My parents took me to visit him three days
after his birth. He was in an incubator, but he was with his
mother while we were visiting.
I looked at my newborn nephew in amazement. He was so
tiny and so soft. He only weighed four pounds at birth. I
touched his soft hands, tiny fingers and little feet. How
amazing it was to see the new baby! How long would it
take for him to grow up?
After that visit to the hospital, I heard news about
Daniel from time to time. I knew it took a lot of extra work
to raise him. He woke up often at night, and had trouble
eating properly. But day by day, he grew stronger. A year
later, he reached a normal height and eventually began to
eat like a normal kid.
But there was one problem: Daniel wasn’t saying any
words while other babies his age were starting to speak.
He was sixteen months old, but he still wasn’t talking.
That’s what I remembered when they left for the United
States.
Now, almost two years old, he was uttering “Uncle” over
the phone. I was overjoyed to hear this young, sweet
voice saying his first few words. I was so thankful that he
grew from a tiny infant to a boy who could eat, run, sleep
AND speak.

The Guitar Maker
There once were two guitar makers who lived in the same
town in Mexico. One was known for his cheap prices and
the other for the quality of his guitars.
The young builder, who made the cheap guitars, could
make them very quickly. The old builder took his time and
focussed on the quality. Everyone wanted to buy a guitar
because it was a sign of being rich. So both builders were
very busy.
But bad times came to the town, and no one had much
money. The builder who made cheap guitars did well. But
the builder who made quality instruments went out of
business because no one could afford his guitars.
After a couple of years, the cheap guitars that people
bought began to fall apart. The guitars that the old builder
made were still perfect. The people who bought the cheap
guitars were angry, and they went to the guitar maker’s
house to get their money back. They pulled him from his
home and pushed him onto the ground.
Suddenly, a voice called out from behind the crowd.
“Wait!” said the voice. “How can you blame him? This man
never claimed that his guitars were good. He has always
said that they are cheap. It is all of you who are to blame,
for you just wanted to look rich. You didn’t care about the
quality of the guitars. You cared only about how they made
you look!” The voice belonged to the old guitar maker.
“I have spent my whole life learning how to make guitars
that last a lifetime. And I can tell you that something that is
really good takes time,” he said. “They take a lot of effort
and sweat.” All the people went home.
The next day, there was a knock on the old guitar maker’s
door. It was the young guitar maker. “Please teach me
how to make good guitars that will last a lifetime,” he
asked. The old man taught him, and the young man taught
others.
Today, there are many guitar makers in that little town, and
all make guitars that last a lifetime.

Living With Grandpa
It’s not easy living with Grandpa. He snores. He spills his
food. He forgets things. He can’t take his old dog Max for
walks anymore. And, he can’t hear very well. On top of
that, he is always telling me about “the old days”, or
stories that start with, “When I was a boy...”
But something happened one day that made me realize
that my life was better with Grandpa in the house. One
night, as we were having dinner, Grandpa was feeding
scraps to his old dog Max. He leaned over too much and
fell. He broke his arm. We called the ambulance and it
took Grandpa to the hospital. He had to stay there for
about a week.
During that time, our house was completely different. Max
was very sad and would not leave Grandpa’s room. My
dad had no one to watch the baseball games with. My
mom didn’t have anyone to talk to all day at home. And I
was so used to Grandpa’s snoring that I couldn’t sleep!
We received many phone calls from people asking about
Grandpa. A local policeman dropped by because he was
used to seeing Grandpa sitting on the front porch in the
evenings. They chatted together regularly.
I missed the stories he told, even though I had heard them
many times before. I soon realized that he was a special
guy, and that he had taught my father to be a great parent.
Food came from all our neighbours to show that they were
worried about him too. But the real lesson came from a
friend of mine who said, “I wish my grandfather was alive.
You’re lucky to have him there.”
The day Grandpa came back, we had a huge celebration
at our house. We now know how important he is to our
home and our lives. One of Grandpa’s favourite sayings is,
“You never miss the water until the well runs dry.”
Grandpa, you are so right!
