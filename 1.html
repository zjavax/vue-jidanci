    Good Little Bugs
    My sister can’t stand anything that is not clean. She
    washes her hands a lot. Everything has to be clean, clean,
    clean!
    I’m not like her. I enjoy touching the earth. I love playing in
    the mud!
    When we went for our regular check-ups, the doctor told
    us, “Everyone has some bugs or bacteria living on their
    bodies. They’re so small that you can’t even see them.”
    “Is that true?” I asked,
    “Yes. And no matter how hard you try, you can’t get rid of
    them,” said the doctor.
    The doctor explained, “Some types of bacteria can make
    you sick. But other types are good, like the ones in
    cheese, yogurt and bread. They make these foods taste
    good! Bacteria are even used to make chocolate bars!”
    My sister was not happy to hear this. “Yuck!” she said. I
    don’t think she’ll be joining me in the mud any time soon!

    Our New Year’s Show
    Our school put on a show to celebrate the New Year.
    Each class, from kindergarten to Grade 6, was to do at
    least one thing -- dancing, singing or poetry reading.
    Who would be in the audience? Of course, there would be
    lots of teachers, students and parents.
    The day of the show came. The show started with the
    kindergarten class. A group of kids, ages three to four, got
    on the stage.
    Their teacher held the hand of the first kid. The rest
    followed them, hand in hand.
    When the music started, all the children started dancing in
    their own way. Two little boys were just standing there,
    watching the audience. People applauded to cheer for
    them.
    When the music stopped, the class turned to leave. But
    one little girl didn’t want to leave. She wanted to stay on
    stage and keep dancing.
    People laughed. In the end, the teacher had to carry the
    girl off stage.
    Everyone had a good time. It was a lot of fun to have our
    own show for the New Year’s celebration!

    Pot of Wisdom
    (adapted from an African tale)
    Long ago, when the world was young, a spider was given
    a pot containing all the wisdom of the world. Each day, he
    reached into the pot and learned something new.
    But Spider would not share. He wanted to keep all the
    wisdom to himself.
    Spider made a plan. He began to climb a tall tree. “I will
    hide the wisdom pot way up high,” he said. “I will be the
    wisest one in the world.”
    As he climbed, he had a lot of trouble. The pot kept getting
    stuck in the branches.
    From below, Spider’s son watched. He called out , “Tie the
    pot to your back, Father.
    That way, it will be easier to climb.”
    Spider got mad. He thought, “My young son is wiser than
    I. I have the wisdom pot, yet he is wiser.” Spider got very
    mad and threw the pot to the ground, breaking it into many
    pieces. Everyone picked up a piece of wisdom.
    And that is why many people know different things. But no
    one has all the wisdom in the world.
