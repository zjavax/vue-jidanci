Fishing Derby
Every year in my town, we have a fishing contest. It’s very
exciting, and everyone wants to catch the biggest fish. If
you win, you get a trophy and your picture in the local
newspaper.
The rules are easy. When you catch a fish, you take it to
the newspaper office and they weigh it. At the end of the
day, the kid with the heaviest fish gets the prize. All you
have to do is fish, fish, fish and if you’re lucky, you’ll catch
the biggest.
I’m a girl, so the boys make fun of me for wanting to win.
They say things like, “Girls shouldn’t be in this contest.
Fishing is a boy’s sport.” It makes me mad, but it also
makes me more determined to win.
This year, I brought my fishing rod and my lucky fishing
bait to a small lake near the town. Billy is the town bully.
He decided to fish near where I was fishing. All day, he
made rude comments about girls and fishing. I tried to
ignore it. Still, it hurt a little.
Towards the end of the day, I had a few small fish, but I
knew they were not big enough to win.
But finally, I caught a huge fish. It took a lot of skill to bring
it to shore, but I managed! I decided to take it to the
weighing station. As I was leaving, I noticed that Billy had
a fish too. Not as big as mine, but pretty big. I was still
sure that mine would weigh more.
That night, Mr. Jones announced that Billy had the biggest
fish. Billy looked at me and sneered, “I told you that girls
are not good at fishing.”
A little later, Mr. Jones made another announcement. He
said that Billy had cheated. Apparently, Billy had put some
small stones inside the fish’s mouth, and that made it
weigh more than the true winner’s fish.
“Sally is the winner,” Mr. Jones announced. “She’s a true
sportsperson. She did not cheat.”
When I look at my trophy, I smile. Girls can be good at
anything. Best of all, I won the contest fair and square.

Our Perfect Puppy (I)
My sister and I have always wanted a dog. My favourite
type of dog is called the Labrador Retriever. They’re pure
black with a shiny coat. They’re friendly. They’re great
swimmers. And they are very smart. In fact, they’re often
used to help blind people.
One day, my sister and I were at a store getting some eye
glasses made. I was bored waiting for my sister to get her
eyes examined, so I went to a store where they sold pets.
When I walked in, my eyes lit up. Sitting in a cage were
two black puppies. The sign said Labrador Retrievers. I
asked the girl if she could tell me more about the two
puppies. She told me one was a boy and the other, a girl.
They were just one month old. They were so cute. They
both looked at me with their beautiful eyes, and whined
and wagged their tails. I couldn’t take my eyes off these
two puppies. They were so adorable!
I brought my sister over. She liked the dogs, but felt that it
wasn’t a good time to get a dog.
On the way home, I finally convinced her that a puppy
would be perfect for us. When we arrived home, we
begged our parents to let us have a puppy. My father said,
maybe -- if we would work more on our chores. No
problem. Right after supper, I rolled up my sleeves and
washed the dishes. I saw my mother smiling.
About a week later, we went back to the store and the
puppies were still there. We chose the female. She was
shaking in the car, but she licked my hand and was very
happy to see us. I could not help thinking about how she
would miss her brother, but we couldn’t take both puppies.
We got home and made a nice warm nest for her. She fit
in perfectly. We gave her a name: Katie.
Finally, we had a pet -- a Labrador Retriever.
11-3
Our Perfect Puppy (II)
Over the next few months, Katie grew bigger and stronger.
Whenever people would come to the house, she would
jump up and try to lick them. But that’s a bad habit for a
dog, so we took her to obedience classes where she
learned to be calm and to understand our commands.
Katie is now two years old and fully grown. And that’s
where the problem is -- she stopped growing at about 30
kilograms. That’s about five kilograms underweight for a
Labrador.
We took her to the veterinarian. “This dog is not a
Labrador Retriever,” he said. “It’s a mixture of breeds.” We
were angry because we paid full price for a pure Labrador.
We called the store and they agreed to give us some
money back.
But one day, Katie’s small size came into use. We got a
kitten to keep Katie company. Unfortunately, Katie often
scared the kitten. One day, we heard the kitten crying. It
was behind a wall near the furnace in the basement. It
was scared and we couldn’t reach it.
Katie was whining and trying to get into the room, but we
knew if the kitten heard the dog it wouldn’t come out. The
kitten was there all day.
The next night at supper, Katie ran downstairs and
managed to get into the furnace room. She found where
the cat was hiding and began to whine. Maybe it was
because of a mother’s instinct, or maybe she was just
tired of having no one to chase, she started to squeeze
between the two walls. I tried to stop her, but she was
gone.
She worked her way to the kitten. Suddenly, we heard a
loud meow and we could see Katie backing up. She
squeezed her way out. In her mouth, she was carrying the
kitten.
My sister and I cheered. The dog had a very special treat
that night. She may not be the right weight or the right
size. She may not be a pure-bred Labrador Retriever. But
to us, Katie is the perfect dog.

My Smart Phone
I bought a smart phone! Like millions of other smart phone
owners, I could barely contain my excitement when I
brought this little gadget home.
I had saved my allowance to buy this phone. It was very
expensive, but I really wanted it. It had many fine features
-- touch slide buttons, and automatic horizontal and
vertical orientations. It’s just amazing.
I loaded it with my favourite pictures and songs. Now, I
take it with me everywhere I go. It’s a very cool phone. It’s
more than a phone -- it’s like a fashion statement or a part
of your identity. I developed a feeling of smug superiority
over other cell phone owners. It’s my most valuable
possession.
This summer vacation, I visited my grandparents. Of
course, I brought my smart phone. I used it to call my
friends, listen to music and take pictures.
One day during this vacation, an old friend of my dad’s
invited us to have lunch with him. He was delighted to see
me as a grown-up. He insisted on buying me a gift -- a
small bag with an elegant design -- simple and stylish. It
had a button that closed with magnets. I thought it was
perfect for carrying my smart phone. I thanked him and
accepted his gift.
The next day, when I pulled my smart phone out of the
bag to make a call, there was a message that said,
“Repair needed: cannot make phone calls.” My new smart
phone had mysteriously stopped working. I couldn’t make
any phone calls, but I could receive phone calls. What
could be wrong? I called customer service many times.
They were not sure what the problem was.
After a lot of research on the Internet, I figured out that my
smart phone was damaged by the magnetic button on my
new bag. How could someone design something so
delicate and fragile? How could the manufacturer give no
warning about it?
The little magnet destroyed my beloved smart phone.
Now, I tell everyone about the lesson I’ve learned. Don’t
let anything with magnets get near your smart phone. It
will destroy your phone in an instant.

Accidental Discovery
My parents sometimes celebrate a special day by opening
a bottle of wine. They prefer a special kind of wine called
Canadian ice wine.
My mother told me the story of ice wine. To make it, the
grapes, which are the main ingredient in wine, must be
frozen solid on their vine. You might think this is strange.
Aren’t most great wines made in places like southern
France where the climate is warm year-round?
Well, that is true. But sometimes a great new product is
discovered by accident. And that’s exactly how we got the
world’s first ice wine.
In the 1700s in Germany, the story goes that one year, a
man was away from his farm in the autumn. The weather
turned really cold and his grapes froze by the time he
came back. It seemed like a disaster. But the man tasted
the grapes and found them to be very sweet. The freezing
weather made the sugar more concentrated, and that
makes for good wine. He decided to make some wine
using these grapes. People really liked his wine, and the
rest is history. For two centuries, Germany was the only
place making ice wine.
Then, a Canadian got the idea that this great wine could
be produced in Canada. After all, the winters are cold in
Canada, and that is the main requirement for making ice
wine. A few grape farmers began to experiment. They
figured out the best process, and soon, Canadian ice wine
was being sold around the world.
The story of the discovery of ice wine got me thinking.
What other inventions came about by accident? Well, to
name a few: the microwave oven, penicillin, and the
pacemaker -- which helps regulate the heartbeat of
patients with heart problems. Imagine the world without
these three things. Two of them have saved countless
lives. And the microwave has certainly changed the way
we cook.
Life is sometimes like that. When we’re looking for one
thing, something even better comes along... if we keep our
eyes open and our minds alert.

The View From the Elevator
There was an important young man who worked in a big
building in an important part of the city. Every day, he
would ride in the elevator with the poor old man who
operated the elevator.
The young man never talked to the old man except to tell
him on which floor he wanted to get off. This went on for
years.
One day, as the important man was taking the elevator up
to the top floor, the elevator suddenly stopped.
The two men sat for hours waiting for the elevator to be
repaired. Finally, the poor old man spoke to the rich young
man, “For years, I have been listening to you as you ride
my elevator. All you ever talk about is money and how to
make more money. You remind me of a bee that never
stops gathering honey.”
The rich man looked at him strangely, but the old man
continued to speak.
“If you take a bee and put it in a tall drinking glass without
a lid on it, the bee will not fly out. Why is that? The bee
never takes the time to look up. In fact, it will die in that
drinking glass when all it has to do is fly out the top to
freedom. My advice to you is this -- don’t just be a bee.
Look up and see the sky once in a while.”
After this, the two men sat talking for hours in the elevator.
The rich man listened to the wisdom of the old poor man.
Just before the end of the work day, the elevator started
working again. The old man asked the other if he still
wanted to go to the top floor.
“No,” he said. “I want to buy you dinner.”
“Why?” asked the old man. As the elevator door opened,
the rich man put his arm around the old man and said,
“Because you just showed me a whole new view of the
world from the inside of an elevator!”
His days of just being a worker bee were over.

Vlad Dye, the Science Guy
Our teacher announced that our class would split into
groups and each group would make a video about the use
of dye, a substance used to colour various materials. The
following week, each group would bring its video to a class
of Grade 5 children and let them choose which one they
liked most.
After a hot group discussion, our group agreed that Vlad
would be our actor. I took the job of cameraman, and
Adam was in charge of post-production.
How was the movie going to be made? We each had an
idea, but we finally decided to make a comedy movie with
a game show in the middle of the film. The name of our
movie was Vlad Dye, the Science Guy.
After preparing everything -- the scripts, the camera, and
the scenes -- we started filming. It was much more difficult
than we had anticipated. Vlad found it impossible to
memorize the whole script and I found it extremely difficult
to keep a steady hand for an entire scene. Adam admitted
that it wasn’t easy to create a game. Vlad constantly forgot
the words, and my hands shook uncontrollably. We didn’t
have a single complete scene after a full day of hard work.
The next day, I came up with an idea. I printed all the
scripts in large fonts and stuck them right above the
camera. That way, Vlad could simply read the script rather
than memorizing it. I started using a chair to steady my
wobbly hands. We filmed scenes in the house, in the
school and in a vegetable market where we explained that
red dyes used to come from red onions. We filmed Adam’s
game show in just one attempt!
The following week, our class presented ten films to the
Grade 5 class. There were all kinds of movies from
students acting as professors to students dying their hair
five different colours.
But it was our film that took the spotlight. Adam’s game
show of Vlad choosing the safe drink from a batch of
poisoned dyes made everybody laugh until they cried.

The Pyramids of Egypt
The Great Pyramid on the Giza plateau in Egypt has
always bewildered people.
Who built it? How was it built? What is its significance?
Finding definite answers to these questions is not as
straightforward as you might think.
Long ago, the history of human beings was not recorded.
As ancient societies died out, their histories died with
them. Now, most of this information is buried. Some of it,
like the ancient pyramids of Egypt, sits above ground –
unexplained and mysterious.
Archaeologists help us to explain things. They dig at old
sites and collect objects that were used by ancient
cultures. Using their imagination, they come up with their
“best theory” about what these objects tell us about the
people who used them.
We know for sure that the Great Pyramid was constructed
around 2600 BC. It contains nearly two and a half million
blocks of stone. Some of these stones weigh nearly 70
tons. How were these blocks moved? How did the workers
move them up the tall structure to heights of 146 metres?
There are numerous measurements contained in the
Great Pyramid that point to a knowledge of mathematics,
science, astronomy and world geography that we would
not have expected from the Egyptians.
The builders of the Great Pyramid were determined to
keep their secrets to themselves. When the first modem
visitor discovered the pyramid in the 19th century, he
wasn’t even able to find the entrance because it had been
so carefully disguised by the builders.
After tunneling aimlessly for weeks, he accidentally
discovered the Entrance Passage, only to find that the
builders had blocked it with a massive stone plug. His men
tunneled around this obstacle and arrived at the entrance.
It was blocked by another huge stone. When they finally
cut it away, another stone immediately fell into its place,
blocking the passage again. An intruder would have to
remove each successive block of stone to enter the Great
Pyramid.
Why did the Egyptians make it so difficult to gain entry?
Was it only the gold and treasure of the king’s burial they
wished to conceal? These questions, as with most things
from the ancient past, are easier to ask than to answer.

Read the Instructions!
My older brother and I once decided to work during the
summer planting trees. It was good pay and the work
seemed interesting. We were both young. And we thought,
“How hard could it be to plant little saplings all day? It
would be great to be in the sun and get some fresh air.”
Little did we know...
When we arrived for our first day of work, the man in
charge took a long look at us and said, “Did you boys read
the instruction you got about how to dress?” We had not
really taken the time to read the instructions carefully.
“Well boys, you’re wearing T-shirts. Do you know who
loves T-shirts?” he asked.
“Not really,” we answered.
“Mosquitoes!” he replied with a smile. “But you won’t even
feel the mosquitoes. Do you know why?”
“Why?” we asked.
“You’ll be so busy getting bitten by blackflies that you
won’t even notice the mosquitoes!” He laughed as he
walked away. We looked around and saw that the other
workers were wearing long shirts and hats.
A couple of the other workers came over to us and said,
“Here, take these extra shirts.” A couple of others gave us
hats with mesh covers, but we still didn’t have long pants
to protect our legs from the biting insects.
We rode in a truck to the side of a mountain. And within
ten seconds of opening the door of the truck, I heard a
buzzing sound. It was the sound of blackflies. They had a
really nasty bite! Soon, we were swatting flies every few
seconds.
It was the worst day of my entire life. When we got home
that night, my legs were covered in big red bites. My
brother’s legs were too.
We went back fully covered the next day and did not get
bitten once. Now, when I hear the buzz of a blackfly, I think
of that terrible day. It reminds me of the great lesson I
learned that day -- always read the instructions!

Confucius: Thinking Deeply
Every culture produces men and women with sharp minds
who spend their days thinking about the world and how to
live a good and happy life. They are the philosophers.
One famous philosopher, Kong Zi, lived and worked in
China from 551 BC to 479 BC. In English, this great
philosopher is called Confucius. He gave China and the
world some deep insights into life and how to live it well.
His philosophical ideas are known far and wide. His work
is studied in philosophy departments at major world
universities.
Philosophers have opinions about almost everything.
Confucius identified three main truths about how to live a
good life. First, he said we should respect the king. Next,
we should do everything possible to respect each other.
Finally, he believed that we can have a really good and
happy life if we learn to live in harmony. This means that
we should try to find a way to live peacefully both with
each other, and with the natural world.
During his lifetime, Confucius travelled throughout China,
working as a teacher and a government administrator.
Wherever possible, he tried to put his ideas into action.
None of his wise sayings were written down while he was
alive. His friends and followers collected them after his
death. Slowly, people everywhere were exposed to his
wisdom. His ideas took root. People could see that
Confucius knew what he was talking about.
It is interesting to note that many of his sayings are quite
similar to those of other great philosophers. For example,
his Golden Rule says: “What you do not want others to do
to you do not do to others.” Hundreds of years after the
death of Confucius, the religious philosopher, Jesus, said
nearly the same thing with his Golden Rule. It advises us
to: “Do unto others as we want others to do unto us.”
The two men lived in different eras and grew up in
different cultures. However, they both came to many
similar conclusions. That’s how it is with philosophers.
They think deeply about life. Much of their advice is true
no matter where you are in the world.

A Famous Singer
Joyce is a famous singer. She’s a new pop star, admired
for her beautiful voice and the popular songs she
performs.
One night, a large charity organization put on a show to
collect money for blind children. The charity organizers
invited Joyce to sing at the show.
Tickets sold out quickly. People flocked to the theatre early
that evening on the day of the concert.
At 7 o’clock, the curtain opened and Joyce made her
entrance and started singing her latest hit song, Let the
world be filled with love. The audience cheered and
applauded enthusiastically. They really enjoyed her
beautiful song and her voice. They clapped long and hard,
and would not let her go. She continued singing one song
after another.
Then, the host of the show asked her to say something to
the audience. She said that it was her pleasure to be
there, especially for such a good reason. Next, she
announced that she would sing a song with someone she
had known for a long time. The person walked to the front
of the stage. To the audience’s surprise, Joyce introduced
him as her brother, Neal. She said that he worked as a
machinist in a factory.
As the two began to sing, the hall became silent. The
audience was fascinated that both Joyce and her brother
had such great voices.
When the performance ended, the audience stood
screaming and clapping wildly. They were overjoyed by
the beautiful performance. Joyce knew that her brother
was a surprise to them. Smiling at the audience, she said,
“To tell you the truth, Neal is not the best singer in my
family. And neither am I. The best singer in our family is…
our father. I’d like him to come up here on stage.” Her
father did. He nodded to the audience with a smile. Then,
he began to sing a traditional song in his deep voice.
The crowd listened in amazement. Most of them could not
help thinking how lucky they were to see this very special
show by such a talented family.
What a surprise! And what an enjoyable night!

Let It Snow!
In the city where I live, the temperature gets very hot for
about two months every summer. My friends and I have
fun swimming and playing volleyball at the beach.
In autumn, the leaves change colour. As far as the eye
can see, the view is out of this world. The leaves on the
trees are magnificent -- bright oranges, intense reds, and
brilliant yellow hues.
Then, around November, things begin to look pretty dull.
The trees become bare. The temperature drops. And the
days get shorter. After about one month of this, I start to
get a little depressed.
But there is one thing that keeps me going – thinking
about snow. Snow comes in so many different forms and
types. Some snow is good for skiing and other snow is
good for making snowballs.
The snow we like most is the “packing snow”, which forms
only when the temperature is just below zero. Packing
snow is heavy compared with other types of snow. It
makes our teachers worry. They know we will make
snowballs with it and start throwing them around.
I love the first snowfall of the year. First, it gets dark and
windy, and then it begins to snow. One tiny snowflake falls
from the sky right in front of me and lands on the sidewalk.
I bend down to see it. Soon another one falls beside it,
and then another. I look down the street and there are
millions of snowflakes in the sky, falling softly to the
ground.
Within minutes, the entire city changes from grey to white.
People smile at each other and everyone realizes that
winter is here.
One year when this happened, I saw an old man who had
fallen in the snow. I went over to help him up. He thanked
me, and then I saw that he was holding something in his
hand -- a snowball. “Watch this,” he said, and he threw it
at a sign. He missed, but you know what? He didn’t miss
by much.
Ah snow! You’ve got to love it.

Disaster on the Ocean
Every day, nearly 12 billion litres of oil are consumed
around the world. Much of it is transported in overland
pipelines, from the oil wells where it’s found to the
countries where it will be used.
However, the majority of the world’s supply of oil is loaded
onto “super tanker” ships and transported to distant
destinations.
With so much oil moving on the world’s oceans, there are
bound to be accidents. Humans make mistakes. Ships run
into bad weather. They are driven off course and tossed
on rocks. Sometimes, the ships break. Millions of litres of
oil spill out into the ocean. When this happens, an
ecological disaster begins.
To understand why an oil spill on water is so dangerous
for the environment, you have to understand the
properties of oil and water. The two liquids do not mix.
This fact can be easily demonstrated. Put some water in a
bowl. Add a few are consumed drops of oil, and see what
happens. The oil floats on top of the water. It quickly
covers everything in sight.
Oil does not sink in salty ocean water. As it comes into
contact with birds and other animals, it begins to cover
them. The fur of sea mammals keeps them warm in the
cold ocean waters. When oil covers these animals, they
get cold. They get sick and die. Some animals try to clean
themselves. They lick the oil from their bodies. It makes
them very sick and they eventually die.
Clean-up specialists have developed ways to deal with oil
spills on water. Large machines are brought to the site to
begin the clean-up. Tools are used to surround the oil slick
so that it will not spread any further. Some machines suck
up the oil like a vacuum cleaner. Others try to soak it up
like a sponge. Some people volunteer to help clean the oil
off the birds and animals.
Until we find a better way to get oil safely from the oil wells
to our homes, spills will continue to happen. For now, a
quick response and international co-operation are the best
hope for avoiding disasters on the ocean.

A Deadly Gas
During the New Year’s holiday, Oliver and his parents
travelled to his rural hometown to visit his grandparents.
One day, as they were having lunch, their neighbour ran in
crying and told them that Mr. Gull had been found dead in
his home. He was killed by carbon monoxide, a deadly
gas generated by his coal-burning stove.
Shocked and saddened by the news, Oliver wanted to
learn more about carbon monoxide, and to educate the
people in this rural village about how to avoid such a
tragedy. “People can’t afford to let this happen again,” he
said to his father.
His father told him that carbon monoxide is nicknamed the
silent killer. It is colourless, odourless, tasteless, and
invisible, yet it’s highly toxic. Exposure to high
concentrations can cause death in just a few minutes.
Carbon monoxide results from incomplete combustion of
fossil fuels. Sources include coal burning, motor vehicle
exhaust, heaters and natural gas -- anything involving fire.
“Is there any way to detect this gas?” Oliver asked.
“Yes,” explained his father. “There are devices that can
detect this gas. When someone inhales too much carbon
monoxide (CO) gas, it blocks the absorption of oxygen
into the bloodstream from the lungs, and also poisons the
red blood cells so they cannot carry oxygen. If body
tissues do not receive a constant supply of oxygen, they
stop functioning. That’s how the biological sensor was
invented.”
“If people don’t have a detector, what should they do?”
“Prevention is the key. Wherever possible, avoid using
fuel-burning devices indoors. If this is not possible, you
can control or limit exposure to CO by properly
maintaining your furnace.”
“Okay, I know what to do,” said Oliver. “I’m going to make
a brochure and a poster about carbon monoxide. I’ll put up
the poster around the village and deliver the brochure to
people’s homes.”
“Great idea,” replied his father. “I’ll be your assistant.”
Their holiday turned into a mission to educate people
about carbon monoxide -- the deadly gas.

Mastering a Musical Instrument (I)
When I was young, I really admired musicians. Who
wouldn’t? They play beautiful music on beautiful
instruments.
Since my elementary school years, I have embarked on a
journey of learning to play musical instruments. I’ve never
stopped learning. Now, I’m almost twenty. You’re probably
thinking, “He must be a music grand master by now.” But
that is not the case. As a matter of fact, I’m still not good at
playing any instrument.
My first music lesson was on the keyboard in Grade 2.1
took music lessons together with my sister. We started
from the simplest thing -- using five fingers to touch the
keys, forward and backward.
At first, I was filled with motivation. The first thing I would
do every day after opening my eyes in the morning was to
practise the seven keys on the wall while lying in bed.
However, after going to the class for two weeks, my
motivation wore thin... and eventually, it disappeared.
True, I liked the keyboard. I was able to make all kinds of
sounds. I just couldn’t stand playing for as long as I was
required to each day. That was too demanding.
A few months later, I picked up the recorder in my music
class in school. The recorder was light, easy to carry
around, and extremely easy to make a sound with. I liked
it right away as soon as my teacher distributed the
instruments in class. This time, I wanted to be good at it --
like a professional performer. I brought the recorder home
that day and I practised. I practised at home every day
after school for three days!
No matter how hard I tried, I could never seem to create
the beautiful tunes that I heard in the movie Titanic.
Blowing a steady flow of air into the opening while
precisely covering the holes at the same time wasn’t as
easy as I had thought. So I lost interest in the recorder.
It was taking too long to become good at it.
It made me wonder then where my dream would drift to.
11-16
Mastering a Musical Instrument (II)
When I started Grade 6, we had a new music teacher.
This teacher told us that she would organize a band for
our school. The band would give a New Year’s concert for
our parents.
I was really excited. Here was my big chance again! This
time, I decided to play a cool instrument -- the gold and
shiny trombone! Since I had grown big and strong, I could
blow into the trombone to get a very loud sound. In fact, I
was one of only two students in the entire class who could
make this monstrous sound.
“Enough playing around with kiddie instruments,” I
thought. “This time it’s serious.” After I learned the basics
in the classroom, it was up to me to practise. I practised bit
by bit. I even played for my mother. When she heard me
trumpeting the song Mary Had a Little Lamb, she laughed
and said it was quite unique.
At end of the year, I played with the rest of the band at the
concert. But, I returned the trombone to school
immediately after the performance, thinking that I could
never do a solo. I thought I should change to something
else.
The years passed, and I continued my quest to find the
“perfect” instrument, touching many and hoping to master
at least one. I watched a Western movie with a hero who
played the harmonica, and I immediately fell in love with
the little instrument. But this only lasted until I watched an
action movie in which the hero played the guitar. This, I
tried and then abandoned a few months later, concluding
that my fingers were too short.
Finally, on a trip to China, I noticed a blind man playing a
stringed instrument called the Er Hu. I bought this two-
stringed instrument and carried it by hand for thousands of
kilometres back home, only to give it up two months later.
Of all the instruments I tried, none could easily satisfy my
goal. If I’ve learned anything, it’s that they all take time,
patience, and hard work.

The Evergreen Trees
(adapted from a traditional Danish tale)
A long time ago, trees in forests kept their leaves year
round. Summer or winter, it didn’t matter. That’s just the
way it was. But one winter, things changed, and would
never be the same again.
The cold winter winds were blowing, and the birds were
flying south where it was warm. All the birds, that is,
except for one small bird with a broken wing.
As the injured bird watched its friends going south, it stood
thinking, “I will be dead before you come back next
summer. I will not survive this coming winter.”
The little bird hopped along, its broken wing hanging
uselessly at its side. It came to a huge oak tree. “Please,
Mr. Oak,” said the bird. “May I take shelter on your
branches for the winter?”
The oak tree huffed and puffed. “Move on, bird,” said the
oak tree. “I am the king of the forest. I will never accept
you on my branches.”
And so, the bird came next to a white birch tree. The birch
tree thought it was the prettiest tree in all the land. When
the little bird asked for shelter, the birch tree said, “Go
away from me! I must take care of my beautiful leaves.
You will get hungry and eat some of my leaves. No, no,
no! Move along.”
The winter was fast approaching. The injured little bird
finally came to a big spruce tree. “May I take shelter in
your branches?” pleaded the bird. And, to its surprise, the
spruce tree agreed. “Come, little bird. You may rest with
me and I will do my best to keep you warm.” And so, the
bird found shelter in the branches of the kind spruce tree.
A pine tree noticed this and said, “I will stand here all
winter, little bird. My branches will keep the wind from you.
Do not worry. You will be safe with us.”
Later, the cold North Wind came to blow in the forest. It
blew so hard that it knocked all the leaves from the oak
and the birch. It was going to blow the leaves off the
spruce and pine too, but its father said no, for he had seen
the good work of these trees in helping the bird.
And that, dear friend, is why some trees lose their leaves
in winter, and some do not.

A Mad Professor
Denis Rancourt is a renowned physics professor. He has
been teaching at the university for nearly 30 years. He is a
leading scientist in his research field, and has published
hundreds of scientific papers and dozens of books. One
day, he decided he did not want to teach the way he had
been teaching for more than twenty years. Why?
It all started a few years earlier. While doing research on
environmental science, he observed that water and land
were being polluted, farms were disappearing and animal
species were vanishing.
“What should I do?” he asked himself. “Should I continue
to focus on my own teaching and research, or should I do
something to stop these things from happening?”
As a deep thinker and a person who cares deeply about
the environment, of course he started doing things
differently. He started a science course that was open to
everyone. He invited speakers to give talks on topics such
as environmental policy, poverty, medical care, war, trade,
globalization and power. He opened this course to all
members of society, and encouraged students to think,
discuss, and take action to make the world a better place.
Once, an auditorium was filled with more than 120 people
to listen to these lectures. Two 12-year-old twins even
registered for his class.
He became a controversial figure on campus. Some
people applauded him for his bravery, sense of society,
social responsibility and for his stimulating teaching
methods. Others criticized him, arguing that he was
ruining the reputation and prestige of the university.
In an interview, some reporters asked him why he
bothered to do all of this at the risk of his own career. He
said that he could not sleep without doing it. “We, as
educators, are obliged to alert people about problems, to
empower young students to become independent
thinkers, and to work on the urgent things challenging us
each and every day. It’s not how many scientific papers
you’ve published or how many books you have written that
matter,” he said. “It’s what you do to stop the bad things
from happening, whether they are right next door or far
away in foreign lands.”
Denis is now known as a mad professor.

Six Months of Sleep
In North America, black bears wander the wilderness as
they have done for thousands of years. These majestic
animals can weigh more than half a ton, and are feared by
many humans.
Black bears are omnivores, meaning they eat both meat
and plants, though nearly three-quarters of their diet is
plants. This poses a problem for black bears living in the
parts of North America where winter lasts for many
months. The plants die off during the winter, and there isn’t
enough to eat.
So, what do black bears do to survive during the winter?
Strange as it may sound, they go to sleep for up to six
months. How do they do it and why don’t they starve to
death during this time? Black bears hibernate during the
winter. They find a safe place, such as a cave or a hole in
a big tree. They crawl inside as winter begins, and they go
into a sleep known as a “stupor”.
But there is much to do before they fall asleep. For weeks,
they eat, and eat, and eat. A black bear can gain up to
twenty kilograms of weight per week during this time. The
bear gets fatter and fatter as the autumn turns to winter.
Then, the bear goes to its sleeping place. As it falls
asleep, its heart rate and breathing slow down. Soon, it is
fast asleep. It’s able to survive during this long sleep
because of its fat. By the end of the six months of sleep,
the bear is very skinny.
Female bears have their cubs while they are hibernating.
The babies are born and begin to feed on their mother’s
milk. They stay close to their mother for warmth.
The sleeping bear even gets some exercise during this
long hibernation. Every day, the bear’s whole body begins
to shake. It shakes in a way that makes every muscle
work.
As the long northern winter ends, black bears begin to
wake up. Imagine how hungry they are! Slowly, they crawl
out into the spring weather. There are new plants and
berries everywhere. The bears eat and eat to gain back all
the weight they lost while sleeping for six months.
Nature is perfect in many ways.

Lucky 13
In 1970, after the successful moon landings of Apollo 11
and 12, it was Apollo 13’s turn to carry humans to the
moon. The number 13 was considered unlucky, and some
people wondered if it was a bad idea to give a spacecraft
this number. But this is a story where 13 proved to be a
lucky number indeed.
About halfway to the moon, one of the oxygen tanks on
Apollo 13 blew up. It ripped a huge hole in the side of the
spacecraft, but no one was injured. A stroke of luck!
Unfortunately, they would not be able to go to the moon.
The truth was that they would probably not even make it
back home.
The craft was quickly losing oxygen, and the crew needed
to conserve battery power while NASA figured out how to
get the men back home. They shut down the power in the
main spacecraft and used the attached moon lander as a
“lifeboat”. They could survive using its oxygen, radio and
rocket engines.
NASA told the crew to circle the moon and let its gravity
shoot them back towards the earth. This meant that they
would have to stay in the cold little moon lander for days.
Meanwhile, there was a concern that they wouldn’t have
enough water and oxygen.
The next big step was to climb back into the main
spacecraft and start it again. Would it start? It wasn’t
designed to sit in the bone-chilling cold of space without
heat. If it wouldn’t start, they would be lost in space
forever. The astronauts followed NASA’s instructions. And
it worked! Some engineers thought this was a miracle.
They now needed to enter the earth’s atmosphere at
exactly the right angle. If they were even slightly off, they
would bum and perish. The whole world was watching to
see if they would make it home alive.
Luckily, they did enter at the right angle, and they didn’t
burn up. But, there was one more problem to overcome.
Would the parachutes open after being frozen for so long?
Well, you can guess what happened. The parachutes
opened, and the spacecraft dropped safely into the ocean.
To many, the Apollo 13 mission is considered a successful
failure. The astronauts cheated death, and that made 13 a
lucky number for the flight.

The Moon or the Banana Tree
(adapted from a traditional African legend)
There was a time, long ago, when only one man and one
woman lived on the earth. They were the first humans
made by a creator with great love and compassion.
The creator wished that they might choose how they
would die when their years ran out. He explained to them
that they could choose to die like the moon, or like the
banana tree.
“If you choose the moon,” said the creator, “each month,
you will slowly die, a piece of you disappearing each night.
But then, you will be slowly born again, just like the moon,
bit by bit. If you choose the banana tree, you will live a
long and good life. But then, you will die forever. But, at
your feet, there will always be fresh young leaves, and
these will grow into new banana trees.”
The man and woman took their time to decide. “If we
choose to die like the moon, we will always have life,” said
the woman. “We will always be here, renewed each
month.”
“That is true” said the man. “But we will always be alone.
We will never have children to laugh with us or to help us
in our labours here on Earth. And it will be a lonely life for
just you and me.”
After much deliberation, they decided to choose to die like
the banana tree. They wanted to have children in their
home. They could not imagine a life without offspring.
When the first man and woman died, there were many
green shoots growing, and there many children on the
earth. In this way, the first man and woman chose to live a
happy life with children.
And that is why we too have only a small number of years
on Earth. But when we die, we leave many descendants
to take our place.

Shoot for the Moon
Every summer on July 19, my dad takes out old books
and pictures and sits at the dining room table. It’s always a
day of memories for him. This is because on July 19,1969,
humans first landed on the moon.
My dad was just ten years old at the time, but he
remembers it like it happened yesterday. His whole family
sat in front of the television and watched the fuzzy pictures
of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin climbing down the
ladder of their spacecraft, and setting foot on the moon.
“Humankind will never be the same after this,” Dad
thought as he watched. “We have left our little planet and
stepped on another space body. Mars is next.” Or at least,
that’s what he thought would happen.
Though Dad felt that the Apollo missions were the best,
the years that followed were disappointing for him
because he always felt we should have gone to Mars.
He always tried to get my older brothers interested in
science. They were good at science, but they decided to
open their own business. You can imagine his surprise
when I, his only daughter, turned out to be the only one
who really loved science.
I loved the space program above all else. I knew all the
astronauts’ names from Yuri Gagarin, the first man in
space, to the most recent crew of the space shuttle.
So every July 19, Dad and I sit and look at his old
magazine pictures about the moon landing, way back in
1969.
The pictures of those men landing on the moon have
inspired me so much that I’ve become very interested in
aerospace engineering. I hope to, one day, go to university
to study it. My dad is thrilled that his daughter is going to
carry on in science.
Aerospace engineering is one of the hardest subjects, and
there are not many girls in the program. Hopefully, I can
inspire some young girls to get into it -- just like Neil
Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin inspired me.

The Man Who Planted Apples
In the early 1800s, in the American states of Ohio and
Pennsylvania, a strange man made a legend of himself.
He was born John Chapman, but everyone came to know
him as Johnny Appleseed.
Why was he famous? Well, this simple man spent his life
planting apple trees in the Wild West. That might not seem
like much, but listen to how he did it. For nearly 50 years,
he wandered the wilderness wearing old clothes and no
shoes. Wherever he went, he stopped and planted apple
trees.
When the American settlers came west, they found an
abundance of apple trees growing everywhere. Fresh
food, especially fruit, was not easy to acquire in this land
at that time. The work of Johnny Appleseed and his apple
orchards was a pleasant surprise.
How did he do it? He spent weeks alone in the wilderness,
carrying a bag of apple seeds on his back. When he found
a good spot, he stopped, planted hundreds of apple trees,
built a small fence around them, and moved on to another
location.
He carried no weapon for protection. He lived in harmony
with the Indians and the animals. He did not wear shoes,
even in the cold winter months. And he relied on the
kindness of strangers for food and shelter. If a settler
could not afford to buy his trees, he gave them on credit or
for free.
Johnny Appleseed refused to eat meat. He talked with the
animals and even slept one night in an old hollow tree with
a bear and her babies.
It’s impossible to know how many seeds he planted in his
50 years wandering the American Wild West, but it surely
must have been tens of thousands. Today, the apple trees
in this area are descendants of those original trees.
During his lifetime, Johnny became a legend. Wherever
he went, he was welcomed. When he was old, he caught
pneumonia one winter while out working barefoot in one of
his orchards. He died at the home of a friendly settler.
Johnny Appleseed’s orchards lived on as a sign of his
selfless dedication and love of nature.

Why Do Leaves Change Colour in Autumn?
Every year, as the summer days grow shorter, an amazing
transformation happens in Canadian forests. As summer
changes to autumn, the trees turn colour -- changing from
summer greens to shades of red, orange, and yellow. It’s a
truly wonderful sight! From a distance, the forest looks as
if it’s on fire.
When I was a boy, my grandmother used to tell me that a
strange little man came in the night with a paint brush to
paint the leaves those wonderful colours. And I believed
her, for it was a wonderful way of explaining this
transformation to a little boy.
But as I grew older, my natural curiosity led me to do some
research on my own. As always, science had the answer.
Trees need food, just like all living organisms. Leaves
produce food for the tree. It’s just sugar, which is
sometimes called glucose. Leaves use sunlight to change
water and carbon dioxide into glucose.
The process by which leaves do this is known as photo-
synthesis. That’s a big word, but it just means “combining
things with light”. A chemical called chlorophyll helps make
this happen. Chlorophyll is the reason why leaves are
green in the summer.
However, Canadian winters are long, cold and dark. There
isn’t enough sunshine in winter for the leaves to make
food. In autumn, as the days shorten, the trees get a
signal to slow down. It’s time to take a rest. Don’t worry,
though. They have enough food stored to last all winter.
When the leaves stop making food, they no longer need to
make chlorophyll. Slowly, the chlorophyll disappears.
Remember, this is the chemical that makes leaves green.
As the chlorophyll goes away, so does the green colour.
We begin to see the other colours that are always there.
We could not see them before because green is a strong
colour.
I still think of my grandmother’s explanation sometimes.
And although I know better now, whenever I look at the
gorgeous autumn trees, I can almost see a happy little
man with a paint brush.

My Sister, the Driver
My older sister, Barbara, was going to get her license to
drive. She has always been a nervous girl, and of course,
taking her driving test made her even more nervous. All
her friends passed on the first try, but she didn’t feel
confident. She knew that when she got nervous she
tended to freeze up.
The big day of the test came, and out she went with the
person who conducted the road tests. We all went with her
to support her. We waited anxiously in the parking lot as
she left with her driving inspector to demonstrate her
driving skills.
Later, as they drove back into the parking lot, we were
waiting for a sign that she had passed. But when I saw her
face, I knew the news was not good. She was not smiling.
The driving instructor got out of the car and walked inside
the building. We looked over at Barbara. She shook her
head and put her hands over her face. She was very
upset. What would her friends say?
Her next driving test came about one month later, and this
time, she was ready. We all went to the testing site where
the instructors worked.
“Don’t stick around at the testing site. It makes me
nervous!” she told us. So we agreed to go for a walk. We
had about an hour to wait until she would be finished.
Later, as we were walking, we heard a horn honking. We
turned to look and it was Barbara driving in the car by
herself! She had passed the test, and she had her license.
She had come looking for us.
We all got in and went for a long drive. She did great. She
was the proudest girl on Earth. I turned to my dad and
said, “I can’t wait until it’s my turn!”
My poor dad, who had just gone through months of
teaching my older sister how to drive, said with a smile, “I
can!”
That day, I realized that it was not easy being a parent!

Gambling With Disaster
Allan is a chef in a restaurant. He earns a good salary,
taking home more than $1,000 a week. However, his life
has become difficult. Why? All his problems can be traced
to his gambling addiction.
Every Saturday, as soon as he receives his paycheque,
Allan immediately cashes it and drives across the river to
the casino. He stays there and gambles it away in just a
few hours.
In the beginning, he promised himself that he would take
only one or two hundred dollars with him. When he lost it,
he would go home. “It’s just a form of entertainment,” he
told himself. But once he started gambling, he could not
stop. He would sit there for hours without noticing the time
going by. Sometimes he won, but most often he lost.
The more he lost, the more he bet. Although he was a
smart man and he knew the odds were always stacked
against players in casino games, he could not seem to
control his urges. Soon, he was spending his entire pay at
the casino.
One night, when he came home late from the casino,
there was a note on the table from his wife. “I can’t take
this anymore,” she had written. “I can’t bear to see you fall
so far down from where you used to be. You no longer
spend time with your children. We rarely talk, except to
argue about money.”
Two months had passed since Allan’s wife moved away
with their two young children. He hadn’t paid the rent for
two months. Then, after another late night at the casino,
he came home to find his apartment locked. On the door,
he found a legal note requiring him to vacate the
apartment immediately, as he had not paid the rent.
He stood in the street, alone and friendless, with no place
to stay for the night. For the first time, it truly hit him how
awful his life had become. Where would he sleep? Hot
tears began to roll down his face and he cried like a baby.

Are You Overweight?
I’m an overweight teenager. I’m only fifteen years old, and
already I weigh over 90 kilograms. I was a normal weight
five years ago, but my weight just kept increasing – faster
than I expected.
Being an overweight kid is not easy.
When I walk down the street, some people make fun of
me. At school, I try to avoid sports activities. Why?
Because I’m not good at sports, as you can probably
guess.
I’m not the only one with a weight problem at my school.
Recently, our school started a program called “Healthy
Kids”. Our teacher invited a doctor to give a talk.
“Do you know that more than one billion adults worldwide
are overweight?” asked the doctor. “Three hundred million
of them are obese, which means extremely overweight.
Adult obesity is linked to being overweight as a
youngster,” he continued.
“Obesity is found in every region of the globe. It’s
estimated that seven percent of the world’s population is
suffering from obesity. The rate of obesity in children is
growing at an alarming rate. Obesity can lead to some of
the world’s most dangerous diseases -- cancer, high blood
pressure, diabetes and stroke.”
“Are we bound to be miserable?” asked my friend, Pam.
“The good news is that we know the two main causes of
obesity -- poor diet and lack of regular exercise. Luckily,
we have control over both of these. It’s never too late to
make changes in your eating and exercise habits. A little
action now can make a big difference in your health in the
future. Isn’t that simple?”
Encouraged by the message, I asked the doctor questions
about how to set a realistic goal.
“Exercise is one of the keys. It has been proven that only
fifteen minutes of exercise a day can go a long way
towards reducing weight. Eat a balanced diet and avoid
soft drinks because they’re loaded with sugar. You can
take control of your own weight if you really want to.”
That day, I decided to become physically active and
maintain a healthy, balanced diet.

A Great Test of Love
(adapted from a Bible story)
Long ago, there lived a good man. He loved his creator
very much and always tried to do as his creator asked. He
desired only to please God.
This man’s name was Abraham. He was a great leader of
his people, and well respected by all. Abraham was
blessed with many children and loved them with all his
heart. His oldest son, Isaac, was a special boy. And
Abraham loved him dearly.
But Abraham’s love was to be put to a test. Would he obey
his creator even when asked to do the hardest thing that
could be asked of a father?
One day, God came to test him to see how strong his love
was. “I want you to sacrifice your son Isaac for me,” said
God. “You want me to kill my only son as an offering to
you?” cried Abraham. But he loved God and trusted in his
wisdom. So, he agreed to do as commanded and set out
with his son and servants.
They walked for three days, arriving at the mountain
where God had told him to build a stone altar and sacrifice
Isaac.
Abraham and Isaac went alone to the mountaintop and
built a stone altar. Then, with great sadness, the old man
tied his dear son to the altar and raised a knife above his
son, preparing to kill him as he had been commanded.
Just as he was about to plunge the knife into his son’s
heart, a voice came and told him to stop. “You have
proved your love for God,” said the voice. “There is no
need now to kill your son. You are worthy and great
among your people.”
Abraham was overjoyed. He untied his son and hugged
him. With great joy, they returned to the people.
Such was the love of Abraham for his creator. His trust in
God’s wisdom did not fail him even in this, the hardest
thing a father can ever be asked to do.

Writing for the Blind
Imagine how scary the world would be if you could not
see.
Blind people live in a different world. They cannot do
things for themselves in the same way that most people
can.
Imagine now, being unable to read a book. Other kids can
read, but you cannot see the words. You hear about great
storybooks. You pick them up and feel them in your hands,
but you cannot read them.
Many years ago, a three-year-old boy named Louis Braille
was playing in his father’s workshop in France. The young
Louis was playing with a sharp tool called an awl. He
accidentally poked himself in the eye with the awl. Soon,
germs got into his wounded eye and spread to his other
eye. In a few days, Louis was completely blind.
His life would never be the same again.
Louis was an intelligent boy, but he could no longer learn
at his school. Luckily for him, when he was ten, he won a
scholarship to attend a school for blind boys in Paris. Still,
he was unable to learn. The school had fourteen books
with special raised letters, but they were nearly impossible
to read.
Louis was discouraged... until one day, a soldier came to
visit. The soldier knew a special code that was used in
war. It was called “night writing”. It had twelve raised dots.
Using these special dots, soldiers could pass secret coded
messages without speaking. They ran their fingers over
the dots and figured out the meaning of the words even in
total darkness.
Young Louis realized that this could be a way for blind kids
to read. The night writing code was too difficult, so Louis
simplified it. He reduced the number of dots from twelve to
six and made many other refinements. Still, his special
code was not accepted by the adults. Louis did not give
up. He worked on this special alphabet his entire life.
After his death, his ‘dot reading’ code caught on. It was
soon being used everywhere to teach blind children to
read. They could now use their hands to feel the letters,
which gave them a new freedom -- to read!
Today, this reading code is named after young Louis. It’s
known as Braille.

Opening Night
It’s opening night. We’ve been working for months on end.
Finally, we’re presenting our school play!
Everyone is nervous. Will it go well? Will the audience
appreciate the play? Will the actors remember all their
lines?
Mr. Brooker, the school’s drama teacher and the play
director, doesn’t have a single line in the play. But he has
a crucial role in making sure everything goes smoothly.
The director guides the cast as they practise their roles.
But he does a lot more than that. He supports them every
step of the way. That’s probably why Mr. Brooker is one of
the most respected teachers in the school.
This year, the drama club decided to put on a modern-day
version of Shakespeare’s tragedy Julius Caesar. It’s about
a king who is murdered by his own generals in an
uprising, and the rebels who are all subsequently defeated
by the loyal followers of the king. It’s an exciting play, but
it’s always difficult to present Shakespeare.
At 7:00 p.m., the auditorium begins to fill with people.
Family, friends and students settle into their seats. Mr.
Brooker sits nervously in his chair, glancing at the stage
crew from time to time.
The stage director -- the person in charge of everything on
the stage -- is carefully checking the entrances and exits,
making sure that the actors can get to the stage on time.
The person responsible for designing and building all the
equipment on the stage, the set designer, is making some
final adjustments.
The lights dim, the curtain rises and the play begins. As
the action unfolds, Mr. Brooker is more relaxed. The actors
know their lines perfectly and deliver them convincingly.
Everything goes according to plan. By the end, Mr.
Brooker is so much into the play that he forgets he is the
director!
With the final line delivered, the play comes to an end. The
auditorium explodes with applause! People jump to their
feet, cheering! The actors come back on stage, each
wearing a big, bright smile. They pull their director, Mr.
Brooker, onto the stage. Together, they take a deep bow.
They are all so proud!
