    An Accident
    One fine summer day, Andy and his friends were playing
    catch in the park. The sun was shining. The grass was
    green. A few hours passed quickly. All of a sudden, heavy
    clouds moved in, and soon it began to rain heavily. The
    kids headed towards a wooden bridge nearby for shelter.
    They ran as fast as they could, laughing at the thrill of
    being caught in the hammering rain. Just as they reached
    the bridge, Ryan suddenly shrieked, “AAAAHHHH!” He
    was in terrible pain. “I got stung by something!” he cried.
    It was a wasp! Everyone took off running. When they
    looked back, they saw a swarm of wasps flying around
    some nests. There were three nests hanging off the top of
    the old bridge. The wasps were mad at these intruders.
    Naturally, they chased the kids away in defence of their
    territory.
    Andy looked at his friend. “Are you all right, Ryan?” he
    asked. Ryan groaned. “It hurts,” he said as he pressed his
    hand to his neck to soothe the pain. The other boys came
    closer to inspect Ryan’s wound. “It’s very red and
    swollen,” said Andy. The boys were worried. “Hurry!” one
    of them shouted. “Hurry and get help.”
    The other boys ran to the road and waved down a van.
    “Please help,” they said. “Our friend was stung by a wasp,
    and his neck is swelling.” The couple in the van quickly
    took Ryan and his friends to a nearby clinic.
    A doctor checked the bite and asked Ryan if he ever had
    allergies before. Ryan said he hadn’t.
    “Three out of every one hundred people are allergic to
    wasp and bee stings. In some cases, these stings can
    even be fatal,” the doctor explained. “It’s good that you
    came in and checked.” Then, she applied a special cream
    to the wound to soothe the redness and inflammation.
    Soon, Ryan felt better. “Thank you everyone for helping
    me when I was in trouble,” he said. Then he became very
    serious. “Don’t go under deserted structures without
    checking. Bee stings are not fun! They can be dangerous
    too.”

    The Principal’s Office
    Four boys sat in the principal’s office, awaiting their
    punishment. They were in big trouble and they knew it.
    They waited for more than 30 stressful minutes.
    When the principal came in, he told the boys, “I’ve just
    spoken to all your parents on the phone. They have given
    me permission to punish you in whatever way I see fit. You
    have caused a lot of work for our janitor by writing on the
    walls today. But he won’t be doing the cleaning. You will.
    In fact, you boys will be cleaning the walls every day after
    school for the next week.”
    After school that day, the boys went to the janitor’s office
    in the basement. He looked at them, and without a word,
    he pointed to some buckets of water, soap and brushes.
    The work took a long time. Whenever they thought they
    had cleaned enough, the janitor would point out at a spot
    that they had missed. But he never spoke. They worked all
    week. It was hard work.
    On the last day, they finally finished the job. But when they
    turned to leave, the janitor spoke. “Hey, come here,” he
    said. He pointed to some chairs, and they sat down. “You
    boys thought you were very smart writing on those walls in
    the bathroom. But, let me tell you something. In the
    country where I grew up, we barely had a school. We
    hardly had books or teachers. Even to get a new pencil
    was a big thing,” he said.
    “You used pencils to write on the walls. A pencil is a lot like
    a person. For a person, there is the point on the outside,
    but what does the work is inside,” he explained. “Every
    once in a while, you have to get a painful sharpening.
    That’s what you’ve had this week,” he said. “From now on,
    instead of leaving your mark on the walls, leave your mark
    on life. Write your own story using what’s inside you.”
    The boys understood and they never wrote on any walls
    again.

    The Amazing Earth!
    Earth -- our home and our planet, is a truly amazing place
    to live. Think about billions of the creatures living on Earth.
    How unbelievable it is that life exists almost everywhere
    on this planet! If you have ever flown on a plane, you’ve
    surely gained a new respect for Earth. Seeing it from the
    air makes you appreciate this precious blue and white
    planet.
    The third planet from the sun, Earth is the only planet
    known to support life. The differences in life forms on
    Earth extend beyond our imagination. At one end of the
    spectrum, there are tiny microbes that can only be seen
    through a microscope. At the other end, there are 30-
    metre long whales that swim through our oceans, covering
    thousands of miles in their travels.
    We have mountains nearly ten kilometres high and valleys
    many kilometres deep. The deepest valleys are
    underwater. These undersea valleys can reach 11
    kilometres in depth. And yet, even under the extreme
    pressure of the water at that depth, life still exists.
    Think of all the creatures that fly through the air. Some
    birds have wingspans over three metres while others have
    wingspans of only a few centimetres. There are bees that
    beat their wings 200 times per second, and swifts that can
    fly non-stop for years, eating and drinking while they fly.
    Look at the trees around you. Some trees are over 100
    metres tall. That’s like a 30-storey building! And they can
    be 1,000 years old. We have soft grass to walk on, and
    trees with needles so sharp that they can make your finger
    bleed if you touch them.
    But the most amazing thing about this planet is the
    people. There are more than six billion people living on
    this extraordinary planet. We live in different places and
    speak different languages, but we all live on the same
    planet and enjoy the same sun, the same air and the
    same water.
    Earth -- our only home, our privileged planet. Humans
    really are a lucky bunch to have such a wonderful place to
    call home.

    A Perfectly Designed Bird
    Everything in the natural world works effectively. Take a
    look at woodpeckers, for example, and you’ll understand.
    Woodpeckers are found everywhere except in Australia.
    There are more than 180 different kinds of woodpeckers --
    some are rare and some are plentiful in numbers. They
    can live from five to ten years and eat mainly insects.
    Woodpeckers are birds. Nothing strange about that.
    But if you watch a woodpecker at work, you might think,
    “That must give it a terrible headache.” After all, a
    woodpecker taps its head against wood nearly 12,000
    times a day. Doing something like that all day long must
    hurt! Think of how you would feel if you hit your head only
    once against something hard.
    However, in nature, everything happens for a reason.
    Woodpeckers are perfectly designed for the life they live.
    They have long, sharp beaks which they use to make
    holes in trees to find tasty insects inside. Unlike most
    birds, woodpeckers have four toes -- two pointing forward,
    and two pointing backward. The toes are sharp, and the
    special front-and-back design allows them to hold on
    tightly as they bang their heads against trees. They also
    have a strong tail feather, which they use to keep their
    balance while they work.
    But how do woodpeckers avoid brain injuries when they
    spend so much time pounding their heads against tough
    tree bark? One of the most interesting things about
    woodpeckers is their tongue. It is very long -- sometimes
    twice as long as the bird itself, and it has a sticky
    substance on its surface. When a woodpecker sticks its
    long tongue inside a tunnel in a tree, the insects stick to it.
    The best part of all, though, is that the woodpecker can
    wrap its long tongue around its brain case inside its head.
    Imagine that! Its tongue acts as a shock absorber to
    protect the bird’s brain from injury. Each time the bird hits
    a tree with its head, its tongue acts like a pillow -- soft and
    springy -- to protect its brain from the blow.
    That’s why a woodpecker can tap and peck all day long
    and not get a headache. It’s just one example of the
    perfection of nature’s design.

    His Brother’s Eyes
    Antonio was a successful Canadian entrepreneur. He had
    a manufacturing plant that produced office supplies. But
    Antonio felt poor because he had no family. In fact, he
    didn’t even know where his relatives were. As he grew old,
    he became very eager to learn about his family. All he
    knew was that he came from Italy as a small child.
    Antonio decided to hire some people to research his past.
    He told them not to let anyone know that he was rich, for
    people might claim to be his relatives to get his money.
    One day, he received a call from Italy. The researchers
    had found the little town where he was from. Soon after,
    Antonio went to northern Italy to find the little town in the
    mountains. He went by himself.
    He looked over the edge of a tall bridge and admired the
    beauty of the area and the river far below. Suddenly, his
    bag slipped and the raging river swept it away.
    Antonio, all of a sudden, had nothing -- no money, no food
    and no phone. He entered the town looking like a very
    poor man. At first, the villagers were wary of him. But that
    evening, they fed him and gave him clothes. Everyone in
    the town was celebrating. He’d never had such a good
    time in his life. Many people commented on his
    appearance and his blue-green eyes.
    Later that night, a small car drove up. It had come from a
    small village up the road. A man got out of the car and
    looked at Antonio. He felt like he was looking in the mirror.
    Everyone gasped as the two stood next to each other --
    their features almost identical.
    When they looked at each other, they experienced a
    strange feeling. They were twin brothers! Antonio realized
    that he had found not only his brother, but also a whole
    village of relatives.
    Over the next year, Antonio set up a small hospital and a
    school in the village, and helped to develop it further.
    Every year, he visited his family. Antonio, the man who
    had everything in the world, had finally found the true
    happiness.

    Musical Math
    My oldest brother is very good at math. He’s an electrical
    engineer. My second oldest brother is even better at math.
    He’s an architect. Then, there is me. I’m not good at math
    at all. In fact, I struggle with it.
    One day, my second oldest brother sat me down at the
    keyboard and showed me the math that exists in music.
    Everything on the keyboard became so simple. It was all
    there in black and white, literally!
    He showed me that there are thirteen notes in a music
    scale, and then they just repeat an octave higher. Then,
    he showed me how chords are made up of combinations
    of notes that are sometimes three whole notes apart, and
    sometimes five, nine or thirteen.
    This was all fascinating, but I didn’t want to learn to play
    the piano. I wanted to be an engineer, like my brother. But
    from that day on, I started to look for math in other things.
    Later that summer, my brother and I went to an art
    museum. We looked at pictures from long ago. We saw a
    sketch by a famous painter. It still had the perspective
    lines showing on it. These lines began at a small point and
    went out in all directions. The painter drew all the houses
    to fit the lines he had drawn in the sketch. It had perfect
    perspective. Here again, was math in art!
    Before school started, we went to the seashore for a
    week-long vacation. There we found some shells on the
    beach. My brother picked up some shells and explained
    how the shells fit a mathematical pattern, going from small
    to large. Math again!
    Well, this all happened when I was about thirteen.
    I’m now an adult. You’re probably wondering what I grew
    up to be. Did I become an engineer or an architect?
    Well, let me put it this way. I use math every day. I divide,
    add, multiply, and I analyze and compare different
    frequencies to see which ones fit with other frequencies.
    Then, I write them down using a mathematical language.
    What’s my job? I write music! I guess I’m a lot like my
    brothers after all.

    The Oak and the Grasses
    (based on a traditional European story)
    Have you ever met people who are rigid and will not yield
    to anyone or anything? They think they know what is right
    and, no matter what, you cannot get them to change their
    mind. They are set in their ways, and according to them,
    nothing will harm them. Their motto for life is, “I am right,
    and I will not bend.”
    On the other hand, you have probably also met those who
    are flexible. They listen to all sides of an issue, and are not
    afraid to change their minds when they’re wrong about
    something. They’re not afraid to bend and bow their
    heads. In a crisis, they seem calm and ready to adjust to
    any situation.
    That was the way it was one day when the mighty oak tree
    had a conversation with the little grasses growing along
    the river’s edge. Noticing that a bird had built its nest on
    these grasses, the oak laughed aloud.
    “How weak and pathetic you are!” said the oak. “That nest
    is nearly breaking your back. You’re so weak! Surely, even
    a small, light wind will blow you over and toss you into the
    river.”
    Upon hearing this, the grasses did not grow angry at all.
    They simply told the oak not to worry about them. “We are
    not worried,” they said. “We can bend and bow our heads,
    and no wind will be able to break us. Surely, it is you who
    should be worried about the wind.”
    The oak roared with laughter, barely able to contain his
    scorn for the grasses. “I’m an oak!” he proclaimed. “I’m tall
    and straight. I shall never bend to anything, especially the
    wind!” he said.
    That night, a terrible storm blew into the area. The
    grasses, true to their word, bent themselves in the wind,
    but the oak did not yield. The wind grew heavier and finally
    broke the tree into many pieces, tossing it into the river.
    When the sun rose the next morning, there were the
    grasses, gently blowing and bending, and enjoying the
    wonderful sunshine.

    An Unlikely Hero
    When I was in Grade 9, our class went on a canoeing trip.
    We all trained hard because canoeing takes a lot of skill. It
    can be very dangerous, especially if the river has rapids.
    To qualify for the trip, you had to be able to swim. One of
    my friends John had a problem. John weighed over 180
    pounds. He had never learned to swim, so he took
    swimming lessons and worked hard for many weeks. He
    eventually graduated with a certificate saying that he could
    swim.
    We were all glad to have him along -- all except one
    person. She didn’t like him. In fact, she seemed not to like
    many. Her name was Nicky. She was on the school water
    polo team. She was a swimming star and very conceited
    too.
    The trip went well and everyone enjoyed the day. That is,
    until the end of the trip when we were heading down some
    rapids. Nicky had been warned over and over to wear her
    life jacket, but she did not listen to others.
    When we arrived at a steep valley, the speed of the water
    picked up. We entered some dangerous rapids. All of a
    sudden, our boat turned over. We were all thrown into the
    water -- all except John! He was at the back of the canoe
    and somehow was not thrown into the water.
    We all swam back to the boat where John quickly pulled
    us in. Then, we saw Nicky’s life jacket floating on the
    water. She was not wearing it when the accident
    happened. When we spotted her floating on the water, she
    was barely conscious. She was in serious danger. It
    seemed like she had hit her head on a rock.
    As we were reaching out to her, our canoe broke loose
    from the tree branches it was stuck to and sent us farther
    away from Nicky. John acted quickly. Mustering up all his
    strength, he paddled the boat against the rushing water
    back to Nicky. He reached into the water and pulled her
    out. She was saved.
    Later, John received a special award for bravery. The
    person that presented it was our best swimmer star and
    water polo player -- Nicky.

    MVP
    Most Valuable Player was what I hoped to get. Yes, MVP –
    the best. Win this award and you are recognized as the
    best player on your team.
    Back in Grade 6, soccer became my favourite sport. I
    watched the World Cup and I was hooked. I wasn’t the
    best player on the team at the beginning of the year. But
    after a lot of hard work, by the end of the year, I felt that I
    was the MVP.
    As the soccer season went on, our team made it to the
    playoffs. We finished second in the city. We were a very
    good team, and I was a big part of that.
    Kenny was the captain, but I had the most goals on the
    team. This was amazing when you realized that I hadn’t
    played much soccer before this year. Kenny would always
    pass the ball to all his players.
    At the end of the year, there was a sports dinner at school.
    People got awards for outstanding performance.
    Everyone on the team felt that I would get the MVP.
    At the end of the dinner, the teacher stood up and
    announced the winners for the awards. The soccer coach
    got up and said, “The winner for MVP is... Kenny.”
    I was shocked.
    After the event, the teacher came up to me and explained.
    He said, “You were the best player on the team, but you
    did not pass the ball. You were out there for yourself and
    not for the team. You have to realize that soccer is about
    the team, not about one individual player.”
    That night, I did receive a trophy. It was called the Most
    Improved Player. It was hard to learn from my mistake,
    and I was embarrassed by what the coach had said.
    But now that I am in Grade 9 and the captain of the soccer
    team, I feel that I have learned that a team sport is not just
    about “you”. It is about “us”. Now I am both a better player
    and a better captain because of this.

    An Earthworm Project
    One day, my aunt invited me to her house to help with her
    new earthworm farm. Earthworm farm? That’s right. Aunt
    Gail ordered a package of earthworms from a company in
    Toronto. She decided to set up a farm right in her house.
    Crazy, you say? That’s what I thought too. But after
    spending a weekend with my aunt, I learned a lot about
    these little creatures.
    I must confess that before visiting my aunt, I was afraid of
    worms. They’re not pretty to look at. They don’t have eyes
    or lungs. They crawl through the earth. They feel weird,
    and they have no personality. Right? But dig a little deeper
    and you will find that earthworms are really a human’s
    best friend. They do so much work for humans, and most
    of us have no idea how special they are.
    Do you know that earthworms have nine hearts? They are
    about 35 centimetres long and weigh about 10 grams. If
    an earthworm gets injured and loses a part of its body, it
    can grow a new part. Wow! Isn’t that amazing?
    In one day, an earthworm eats one third of its body weight.
    That’s why my aunt’s earth-saving project comes in. We
    humans produce a lot of food waste. We peel apples and
    throw out the skins. We do the same with potatoes. Think
    about preparing a dinner, and you will see how much food
    waste we throw away. But there is a much better way to
    deal with household food waste. Start an earthworm farm!
    My aunt’s earthworm farm came in a large can. There
    were about 1,000 worms inside. She explained how it
    works. Worms love to eat organic matter. They turn food
    waste into rich compost, which you can then add to the
    soil in your garden. It’s easy. Put a bit of soil in a large
    can. Add the worms and then the food waste. That’s all
    there is to it. It’s simple, but smart.
    So, you might think my Aunt Gail is crazy, but an
    earthworm farm makes sense when you think about it.
    And it’s easy to set up. Why not find out more about it?
    Maybe you can start one. You won’t be sorry if you do.

    Why We Have Summer and Winter
    (based on a traditional Canadian native story)
    Long ago in the vast, rolling western lands of Canada, the
    Blackfoot Indians lived in peace and harmony with nature.
    But one day, Thunder, who was a jealous spirit, decided
    that he wanted to have the wife of a villager.
    Thunder was strong and dangerous. He enjoyed
    frightening people by sending loud booms across the sky
    and spitting bolts of lightning everywhere. Everyone was
    afraid of Thunder, and he always got his way.
    That’s why it was no surprise when Thunder threw a
    powerful storm at the tent of a good man so that he could
    steal the man’s wife. The man and his wife were hit with a
    bolt of hot lightning and fell unconscious. Thunder then
    snatched the wife and fled to his hiding place in the
    clouds.
    The man grieved for his wife. He searched day and night,
    but could find no trace of her anywhere. He begged the
    animals to assist him, but they were too frightened of
    Thunder and his power. However, Raven, who was a wise
    and gentle spirit, took pity on him and decided to help.
    Raven flew up to the sky and confronted Thunder at his
    hideaway. Thunder threw powerful lightning bolts at
    Raven. But Raven had a power of his own. He flapped his
    big black wings, blowing in the cold north wind and a
    mighty snowstorm.
    The battle raged for days. It seemed as if Raven would
    lose the fight. But in time, the wind and snow slowly
    cooled Thunder’s power, making him weaker and weaker.
    Finally, Thunder agreed to return the woman to her
    husband.
    Knowing that he had defeated Thunder, Raven extracted
    another promise from him. “From now on,” Raven
    declared, “the year will have two parts -- winter and
    summer. Winter will be my season, and summer will
    belong to you.” Thunder agreed since he had been
    defeated and had no choice in the matter.
    And that is why, to this day, we have summer and winter.

    A Patient Photographer
    Many people love taking photographs. Some are
    professional and some are amateur. Some photographers
    specialize in taking pictures of people. Others focus more
    on sports or on nature.
    I want to tell you about a man who did something unusual
    with his camera. He took a series of pictures of a
    dragonfly that was changing from a nymph (a baby
    dragonfly) to an adult. Using his camera, he recorded the
    entire process, which took nearly five hours!
    Mr. Luo took up photography at age 60, the year he retired
    from his 40-year career as a railroad worker.
    When he retired, he became an active member of a
    seniors’ photography club. They organized activities every
    week. Sometimes, they went on bike rides together and
    took pictures. Other times, if it was rainy, they met and
    exchanged tips on how to use light, lenses and software.
    One summer day, Mr. Luo got up at 5:00 a.m. He went to
    a pond in the suburbs where there were always plenty of
    dragonflies. With great exhilaration, he set up his camera
    and recorded the process of a nymph’s transformation.
    First, he found a water bug in the muddy water under the
    lily pads. He waited until the bug climbed up the stem of a
    plant. There, it stopped to rest.
    Fifteen minutes later, the bug’s body began to change.
    The skin split at a weak spot behind the head, and the
    adult dragonfly crawled out of its old skin. One hour later,
    the dragonfly started to separate its wings, which had
    been wet and folded in the beginning. A short time later,
    the dragonfly opened its wings for the first time. In another
    hour, the dragonfly made a pumping motion with its wings
    and flew off in search of food.
    The series of photos won wide appreciation. Whenever
    people praise him for his work, Mr. Luo says, “Don’t give
    the credit to me. Give it to nature. I just used my camera to
    capture the moment and present it to the world.”

    An Airship Falls From the Sky (I)
    It’s lighter than air, and it flies without wings. It can stay
    airborne for days at a time. It’s shaped like a cigar. It has a
    metal frame and gas-filled bags for fuel. For a short time in
    the mid-20th century, it promised to be the way of air travel
    in the future. What is it?
    It’s an airship, also known as a dirigible, a zeppelin or a
    blimp. Perhaps you’ve seen a modern version of these
    amazing flying machines at sporting events in Europe or
    North America. They fly over stadiums beaming television
    images of the playing fields below.
    Nowadays, airships are used mostly for advertising and
    television coverage. But, did you know that only a short
    time ago they competed with fixed-wing airplanes for
    passenger air travel?
    Between 1900 and 1937, thousands of passengers flew
    millions of miles in airships. Travel in an airship was
    similar to travel in the large ocean-going ships of the day.
    People were treated to luxury and comfort.
    However, everything changed one night in 1937. The
    crash and burning of the most famous of all airships, the
    Hindenburg, brought commercial airship travel to a
    sudden end. As news of the crash spread around the
    world, the public no longer believed in the safety of
    airships.
    The Hindenburg was 245 metres long and 41 metres high,
    making it as large as three modem 747 jets. It contained
    sixteen bags filled with 200,000 m³ of hydrogen, the lifting
    gas. The hydrogen gas used to make the Hindenburg
    lighter than air is believed to be the cause of the fire and
    crash landing on its final flight.
    The more popular gas, helium, was expensive and difficult
    to get. Instead, the German builders of the Hindenburg
    decided to use the next best thing -- hydrogen, an
    extremely flammable gas. This would prove to be a costly
    mistake. In fact, it would be blamed for the destruction of
    the Hindenburg, and the death of thirteen passengers and
    22 crew members that fateful night. The public would
    never again feel safe flying in hydrogen airships.

    An Airship Falls From the Sky (II)
    On May 6, 1937, as the Hindenburg approached its
    landing tower in New Jersey, U.S.A., everything was
    normal. On the ground, a large crowd had gathered to
    watch the landing. This majestic airship was the largest
    ever built, and drew large crowds of people wherever it
    landed.
    On board, passengers had private rooms with showers.
    The kitchen held more than two tons of food. Passengers
    met for social activities in a large entertainment room with
    an aluminum grand piano. The Hindenburg could remain
    airborne for days or weeks at a time. While the airship
    cruised at a speed of 120 kilometres per hour, passengers
    could open the windows and look out on the scene below.
    But on this day, as the Hindenburg was being tied to the
    landing tower, a small fire started in the tail of the airship.
    It spread very quickly, covering the entire airship. In an
    instant, the burning airship fell 40 metres to the ground.
    Surviving passengers and crew ran for safety.
    A radio reporter on the scene broadcast live coverage of
    the disaster around North America. In an instant, the end
    of airship passenger travel had arrived. No one trusted the
    safety of these flying ships after hearing the horrific story
    of the Hindenburg’s last minutes.
    The Hindenburg flew for only one year. But during that
    time it travelled 307,000 kilometres and successfully
    delivered 2,798 passengers to their destinations. It made
    seventeen round-trip journeys across the Atlantic Ocean
    and completed a record Atlantic double-crossing in five
    days, nineteen hours, and 51 minutes.
    No one can say exactly what might have happened had
    the disastrous fire and crash landing of the Hindenburg
    not grounded airships. Perhaps we would all be flying in
    luxurious airships today, instead of in the airplanes and
    jets that soon took over the skies.

    Animal Talk
    Do animals communicate with each other?
    This question came to my mind the other day while I was
    sitting outside. I heard some birds making what sounded
    like a distress call. I looked around and saw a cat
    crouched low in the grass, ready to pounce on the birds.
    But the cat was too late. The birds suddenly flew to safety.
    The loud calls had alerted them to the danger.
    I did some research and, to my amazement, I learned that
    all animals communicate. They don’t use language, but
    they do send signals and messages to each other.
    I learned that animals communicate with each other in
    three main ways: through sounds, smells, and body
    language.
    The alarm call is one way that sounds are used for
    communication. When a predator is near, animals send
    out a warning sound. Those who hear it run to safety, hide,
    or gather to fight the invader. Birds sing beautiful songs to
    attract mates during breeding season. Dogs bark and
    growl to show other animals how they’re feeling. Cats purr
    to demonstrate that they are comfortable and feel safe.
    Whales are well known for their ability to communicate
    over large distances with complex vocal sounds. Humans
    don’t understand the meaning of these sounds, but in their
    own social groups, whales understand what they’re saying
    to each other.
    Smell is another popular method of animal
    communication. Simple animals such as the single-celled
    amoeba release a chemical that other amoebae recognize
    as a signal for reproduction. Some animals send out a
    strong smell to warn other animals to stay away from
    them. For example, skunks release a terrible odour when
    they feel threatened.
    There are many examples of animals that use body
    language to communicate. Chimpanzees touch hands
    when they meet. When angry, gorillas stick out their
    tongues. Think of a happy dog wagging its tail. Even
    humans understand this form of dog body language.
    Humans have developed a complex system to
    communicate with each other, using words and sentences.
    But if you observe other animals for a while, you quickly
    come to appreciate that they too have ways of getting their
    messages across.

    My Own Place
    I couldn’t wait to have my own apartment. I have a big
    family with two brothers and two sisters. I love my family
    very much. But I really wanted my own place! I wanted it
    to be just how I wanted it.
    For as long as I could remember, I had been eating the
    food my parents told me to eat, wearing the clothes my
    parents bought for me, and doing the things my parents
    wanted me to do.
    But, I knew that one day I would have my own place. I’d
    paint the walls the colours I wanted, watch the TV shows I
    liked, and arrange the furniture the way I liked it.
    Well, that day finally came!
    Because I was starting my first year of college, I was
    allowed to rent an apartment near campus. It was the first
    time that I had my own apartment. It wasn’t very big or
    very nice, but it was my apartment. It was my place. It was
    about two hours away from my parents’ house. I
    decorated the rooms the way I liked and painted the walls
    the way I liked. I bought food that I liked. It was a very
    special time!
    But something was missing, and I couldn’t quite figure out
    what it was. So I called some friends over and we had a
    party. But the next day, I still felt a little down. What was
    my problem? Why was I feeling so blue?
    While I was sitting on the couch thinking, the doorbell
    rang. I opened the door. Standing there was my whole
    family. There were twenty of them! Brothers and cousins,
    aunts and uncles, and of course, my mother and father.
    They had come a long way to surprise me with a party. I
    was delighted!
    They brought food and drinks, and we had a great time. At
    the party, my father said, “Raise your glass to my son’s
    first home!” I felt proud. When the party was over, I
    realized that even though I had my own place and was
    feeling like a real grown-up, I was homesick.
    Since that party, I visit my family once a week because I
    learned something that day -- there’s no place like home.

    Food Preservation
    We don’t give much thought to food in our modern era. It’s
    just there as a part of our lives -- bananas from Vietnam,
    grapes from California, and milk, meat and vegetables
    from local farms.
    Our prehistoric ancestors would be jealous. For them,
    each day presented a challenge: hunt with success or
    starve. Periods of plentiful food were often followed by
    long periods of famine. There was no way to preserve
    food to be eaten later.
    When it dies, a living organism is invaded by harmful
    bacteria that cause food to spoil. As it rots, it becomes
    toxic. This is where food preservation comes in.
    The goal of food preservation is to destroy these harmful
    organisms. There are six main ways to do that: drying,
    pickling, canning, freezing, freeze-drying and irradiation.
    Probably by accident, prehistoric humans discovered that
    some foods, when left out in the sun, did not rot. They had
    discovered food preservation. Over the centuries, drying
    techniques have been perfected. Furnaces, large fans,
    and artificial heat are now used. But the end result is the
    same -- dried food that can last a long time.
    Another ancient method of preserving food is pickling.
    Food is preserved in a solution of salt, which makes it
    impossible for bacteria to survive. Meats and vegetables
    can be preserved in this way.
    By 1800, a new method came on the market -- canning.
    Food is cooked at high temperatures to kill the bacteria. It
    is then put in a sterile container such as a can or a glass
    jar. The top is sealed to prevent air from entering. Canned
    food can last for 30 or 40 years, and still taste good.
    Then, with the invention of freezers, large-scale food
    preservation became a reality. By cooling food to below
    freezing temperatures, bacteria are killed.
    The latest method of food preservation is irradiation.
    Gamma radiation kills the bacteria, but the long-term
    effects of eating foods to which radiation has been applied
    are unknown.
    Food preservation has come a long way, from drying in the
    hot sun to large-scale preservation in modern factories.
    However, the goal remains the same: to have long-lasting
    safe food to feed the people.

    Jumping for Joy
    (adapted from a European fable)
    There once was a frog who sat and watched the birds all
    day long. He wanted so much to be a bird. “But I am just
    an ugly frog,” he thought. He loved how the birds soared
    through the sky and moved in the wind.
    He decided that he would practise his jumping every day.
    “If I keep practising,” he reasoned, “I might one day be
    able to jump so high that I might fly.”
    There was another frog who loved being a frog. He
    believed that it was the best life in the world. How he loved
    to sit in the warm water and bathe in the mud. He felt sorry
    for birds, who did not like the rain. They could not swim
    underwater and taste the delicious little insects that he
    loved to eat. He jumped simply for the joy of jumping.
    There was nothing more fun. He practised jumping all the
    time.
    One day, the crow, who liked to stir things up at the pond,
    challenged the two frogs to a jumping contest. “You two
    should see who can jump highest,” he said.
    The two frogs accepted the challenge. The happy frog
    made a graceful jump, high up into the air. “Oh, that was
    nothing,” said the frog who wanted so badly to be a bird.
    “Watch this!”
    He crouched down low and then sprung into the air, higher
    than anyone had imagined. All the creatures were
    amazed. “Look, I’m a bird!” he croaked.
    Just then, a huge blue heron swooped down from the sky
    and grabbed the soaring frog in mid-air. In just one gulp,
    the frog was gone.
    That night, a wise old frog told the young frogs, “There are
    three lessons to learn from what happened today.
    One: It is good to have a dream, but make sure that it’s
    realistic.
    Two: Never try hard to impress anyone.
    Three: There can be great joy in simply being who you
    are.”

    The Story of Oil
    Oil -- a liquid that drives our cars, heats our homes and
    provides much of our electricity. It’s found in every
    imaginable product. It’s often referred to as “liquid gold”. In
    its refined state, it’s called petroleum, which literally means
    “rock oil”.
    The long journey of oil, from the source below the earth’s
    outer crust to the fuel tank of a car, begins in prehistoric
    times when the earth was covered in water. Small marine
    life died and fell to the sea bottom, slowly accumulating on
    the muddy seabed.
    There was no oxygen in many of the accumulating layers,
    so the material did not break down completely. This
    allowed much of the decaying material to change into
    carbon and hydrogen atoms. This process repeated itself
    many times over many millions of years. More dead and
    dying materials accumulated on top of the previous layers,
    forming new layers in the rock.
    After millions of years, the rich seas began to recede.
    As the earth dried, additional land-based organic material
    decayed, and went through the same process.
    All that was needed then was the addition of heat, which
    came about as the result of pressure exerted on the
    material by each new layer.
    Heat and pressure increased over thousands of years as
    the weight of the layers built up. This changed the material
    into a gooey substance called kerogen, which later
    changed into a crude oil.
    This crude oil began to trickle away from the source rock
    to varying depths below the surface, until it became
    trapped in reservoirs where it lay dormant for millions of
    years.
    In the 20th century, humans began drilling deep into the
    earth to find this crude oil. It is now shipped to refineries
    where the gooey material is transformed into the valuable
    commodity it is today.
    Gasoline is still the crown jewel. In fact, half of every barrel
    of crude oil is turned into gasoline. The remainder is
    further refined and ends up in many consumer products,
    completing a process that began long before humans
    roamed the earth.

    The Boy in the Grass Boat
    (adapted from a Bible story)
    Long ago, in the land of Egypt, a slave girl gave birth to a
    baby boy. She loved this boy very much. But she was also
    afraid. She believed the king would come and find her
    baby and kill him before he had the chance to grow.
    The girl decided to do something to save her child. It
    broke her heart to part with her new son, but there was
    nothing else to do.
    So, the slave girl made a fine basket out of the reeds and
    plants that grew along the river’s edge. With sadness, she
    put her baby safely into the little basket that was really like
    a small boat, and she cast it out on the water. As she
    stood watching the small boat disappear down the river,
    tears filled her eyes.
    But she knew that what she had done was good. It was
    the only way. “If it is the will of God, my child will survive,”
    she thought.
    At the same time, a relative of the king was walking along
    the riverbank with her servant. Suddenly, she noticed a
    small basket caught in the long weeds. “Go and see what
    that is,” she said to her servant, who did as she was
    commanded. She returned with the basket and the baby
    boy inside.
    The king’s relative looked inside and saw the smiling baby
    boy. “What a wonderful boy this is!” she exclaimed. “How
    did it come that he is alone and abandoned here in the
    river?” she asked herself.
    But it did not matter. The woman had already decided to
    keep the boy as her own. After all, she was a good woman
    and could not allow the baby to die alone in the river.
    The king’s relative took the boy back to the palace, where
    she raised him as her own. She did not know it then, but
    this fortunate child would grow up to become the king’s
    favoured child.
    The boy in the grass boat was destined to do great things.
    He would, in fact, one day lead his people out of captivity.
    He would lead them to freedom in their promised land.

    The Great Bottle Drive
    Our hockey team wanted to raise some money to go on a
    trip, so we decided to have a bottle drive. Bottle drives are
    good because they raise money and the glass is recycled.
    On top of that, people are usually happy to get rid of their
    bottles.
    We went from house to house in our neighbourhood
    collecting old bottles, new bottles, big bottles and small
    bottles -- bottles in every colour and shape. When we
    finished, we had collected over 1,000 bottles. We took
    them to a place that buys glass. There, we began to throw
    them into a huge metal container.
    There was an older woman there who was throwing out
    bottles too. She smiled at us. I was about to throw out a
    strange-looking old brown bottle, when I heard a loud
    voice cry out, “Wait! Don’t throw out that bottle!” But it was
    too late. I had thrown it, and it smashed into thousands of
    pieces. The older woman ran over to me and said, “I think
    that was very old. It was worth some money.”
    “Oh no!” we all cried. After all the work we had done, I had
    just thrown money out the window. We were all very
    disappointed.
    Then Anthony said, “Look! Is this the same kind of bottle?”
    The old lady looked at it. “It’s not as rare,” she said. “But
    it’s still worth a lot of money.” We were excited.
    The next day, the woman took us to an antique dealer.
    He looked it over and offered us $500 for the bottle. We
    were amazed! We had only raised $50 in total from all the
    other bottles.
    We found some other bottles in our collection that were
    worth a few dollars, but I kept thinking about the one I
    threw out.
    I finally had the courage to ask the woman, “The one
    I threw away, how much was that worth?” Then I changed
    my mind. “No! Don’t tell me. I don’t want to know.”
    That day, I learned to be careful when throwing anything
    out! It can sometimes be reused and it might be worth a
    lot of money!

    Squirrels: City Dwellers
    Squirrels are special animals. They are smart, cheerful,
    and frequently seen in cities. They are one of only a few
    wild animals that have learned to coexist with humans.
    To many, the squirrel is a natural wonder. Its large tail
    makes it the most recognized mammal on Earth. It
    amazes us with daring high-wire acts as it jumps from
    branch to branch through the trees. Its determination to
    find a way to get food is a delight to watch.
    Spend some time observing their playful nature as they
    race up and down trees or run across an open field. Watch
    them tirelessly gather nuts and seeds to store for later.
    You’ll be amazed at how much they accomplish in a single
    day.
    Squirrels are forest dwellers by nature. However, many of
    them have migrated to cities over the past one hundred
    years or so. The urban environment is an ideal place for
    such intelligent animals to live. Here they have few
    predators, plenty of places to build nests, and easy access
    to food.
    However, when they live in cities, their intelligence and
    hard-working nature sometimes causes problems. When
    squirrels set up home close to humans, conflicts arise. For
    example, many people enjoy feeding and observing birds
    in winter at their outdoor bird-feeding stations.
    Unfortunately, these stations are excellent places for
    squirrels to gather food, too!
    Of course, squirrels are only following their instincts when
    they raid a bird feeder. They take as much as possible and
    hide it for later.
    Human reactions to squirrels living in cities are as different
    as people themselves. Some adopt the attitude of “live
    and let live”. They learn to tolerate squirrels. They fill the
    feeders more often, and decide that the best way to deal
    with intelligent raiders such as squirrels is to let them have
    a share.
    Squirrels are smart. Humans can try to outsmart them, but
    the squirrels usually win this battle of wills. They live
    according to nature. If anything different, a squirrel would
    not be a squirrel.

    The Lightning Strike
    We were playing in the tree house in our backyard when
    my mother came running from the house yelling, “Get out
    of the tree! Hurry!” A huge storm was rolling in.
    We had just got inside when there was a loud hiss in the
    air. A blinding light suddenly filled our house. Then, it was
    over. All that could be heard was the rain and rumbling in
    the distance.
    When we looked in the backyard, we saw smoke coming
    off the oak tree. It had been hit by lightning! We were
    really frightened to see what lightning can do.
    The next day at school, I told my teacher what I had
    experienced. I asked him many questions about lightning.
    Mr. Neil said that lightning is an abrupt electric discharge
    from one cloud to another, or from one cloud to the earth.
    The discharge is the result of the buildup of electrical
    energy between positively and negatively charged areas.
    “All matter is made up of atoms,” he explained. “An atom
    contains a positively charged nucleus and negatively
    charged electrons that orbit the nucleus. If you rub two
    different objects together, such as your pen and your hair,
    electrons may be transferred from one object to the other.
    The one that gains extra electrons becomes negatively
    charged. The other is positively charged.”
    This was really interesting. My teacher continued, “When
    many small bits of raindrops bump into each other as they
    move around in the air, electrical charges gather at the top
    of the cloud. Negative charges form at the bottom of the
    cloud. Since opposites attract, this causes a positive
    charge to build up on the ground beneath the cloud. The
    ground’s electrical charge concentrates around anything
    that sticks up, such as mountains, people or trees. The
    charge coming up from these points eventually connects
    with a charge reaching down from the clouds and then,
    lightning strikes!”
    Mr. Neil told us that lightning can heat up the air to 30,000
    degrees Kelvin. That’s six times hotter than the surface of
    the sun!
    Now I see why lightning strikes the highest object, and
    why it’s dangerous to stay under a tree during a
    thunderstorm.

    Watches
    I love watches. I like digital watches, but I prefer the old
    watches with their slow-moving hands and ticking sounds.
    The mechanical watches that are full of gears, springs,
    and wheels are my favourite. They’re incredible
    inventions!
    There is so much history behind watches. Many years
    ago, ships had problems navigating because they did not
    have a reliable clock on board. In 1500 AD, a man
    invented a clock that would work on board a ship. It used
    a piece of coiled up metal to keep it working. The first
    clock spring!
    Soon, pocket watches became available, but they were
    expensive. Owning a pocket watch meant you were rich,
    and probably very important. Nearly everyone wanted
    one. But by the 1800s, owning a pocket watch had
    become fairly common.
    In 1800, a Frenchman invented something very special. It
    was called the tourbillon. This is French for “tornado”. It’s a
    device that eliminates timekeeping errors caused by slight
    variations in gravity when a watch changes position during
    use. It consists of a cage of gears that circle around inside
    the watch movement every minute. This ensures that the
    force of gravity on the watch spring is equal at all times.
    Today, tourbillon watches are still produced. In fact, they
    are the most expensive watches you can buy. The
    cheapest of these costs more than a Mercedes car! These
    watches are masterpieces. They have up to 400 moving
    parts inside and can take up to a year to build.
    Sometimes, people don’t realize how amazing these
    mechanical watches are. Sure, you can buy a digital
    watch for almost nothing, and it will give you a very
    accurate time. But, today’s watches are the result of
    hundreds of years of refinement and invention.
    Watches keep us in touch with the world because the
    accurate measurement of time keeps everything running
    in order. Imagine if suddenly every watch and clock on
    Earth stopped. What would we do?
    But fortunately, we don’t have to worry about that now. We
    have our trusted watches. Time to go!

    A Book of Stamps
    Pat became obsessed with detective stories when he was
    about twelve years old. He was a young fan of Sherlock
    Holmes.
    Every day, he tried to find a mystery to solve. One of his
    prime interests was the family safe, which was kept in the
    basement. He kept wondering what was inside.
    After thinking about it a lot, he decided to open the safe
    and look inside. One day, when his parents were away for
    a long weekend, Pat located the PIN numbers kept in a
    notebook in his father’s desk drawer. He was nervous, but
    he managed to open the safe.
    To his surprise, he found only a book of stamps inside. He
    didn’t know if these stamps had any value. To him, it was
    just a book of old Chinese stamps from the early 1940s to
    the late 1950s.
    Where did it come from? Why was it locked in the safe?
    With his head full of questions, he had no way of figuring it
    out. It was really a mystery worthy of Sherlock Holmes.
    When his parents came back, he admitted that he had
    opened the safe and discovered the book of stamps. His
    father didn’t yell at him. Instead, he told him the story
    behind the stamps.
    A Catholic Father, who was a missionary in China from the
    early 1940s to 1960s, had collected these stamps while he
    was preaching in China. Later, he left China and returned
    to his hometown in Canada. Before the Father passed
    away, he gave the stamps to his niece, who then sold the
    stamps to Pat’s father.
    As Pat listened to the story of the book of stamps, he
    imagined how the Father managed to collect all the
    stamps during the war. Pat’s father told him that whenever
    he looked at the stamps, he felt as if the Father was
    talking to him about his days in China. He felt like he was
    asking him to bring the stamps back to where he had
    lived.
    Pat’s father then revealed his plan. One day, in the near
    future, he would hold an exhibition of the stamps in China,
    in the name of the Father.

    Ladders Aren’t Bad Luck, But...
    It sounded simple enough. Paint the back of the house. So
    my little brother and I got our paint, paint brushes, rags
    and a ladder, and headed to the back of the house.
    We were working on scraping off the old paint when we
    heard this loud chattering noise. It was two squirrels
    chasing each other along a telephone line. They were
    jumping from tree to tree and running along the sides of
    houses. It was incredible to watch.
    After a while, I got back to work. As I was scraping, I
    dropped the paint scraper. It fell under the ladder. I told my
    brother to get it for me, but he refused. He said it was bad
    luck to walk under a ladder.
    “What are you talking about?” I said. “Don’t be foolish!” I
    laughed at him and jumped down. Just to prove my point, I
    walked under the ladder back and forth three or four
    times. “Look, is anything bad or unlucky happening to
    me?”
    I climbed up the ladder feeling that I had taught my little
    brother a lesson about superstitions. I started to paint.
    Then I saw the squirrels running along our roof and
    coming straight at me.
    The first squirrel suddenly jumped on the ladder and ran
    down the side of it. The second squirrel followed and the
    two of them began circling at my feet. I was scared and
    moved too quickly. The paint spilled everywhere and the
    ladder started to sway. I jumped off the ladder, and luckily,
    landed on my feet. It hurt, but I was okay.
    I looked at my brother. He was smiling at me with an “I told
    you so” look on his face. But I looked him straight in the
    eye and said, “Look! I told you. Ladders aren’t bad luck.
    Squirrels are!”

    The Frog in the Shallow Well
    (adapted from a traditional Chinese folk tale)
    One day, a frog met a turtle that lived in the East Sea. “I
    am so happy!” said the frog to the turtle. “I live in a great
    well. It’s a wonderful place to live in. Sometimes, I go for a
    walk on the land. When I come home to my great well, I
    rest in the holes on the broken wall of the well.”
    “When I jump into the water, it comes up to my armpits
    and holds up my cheeks. I look around at the other small
    and unimportant creatures living in the well, and none of
    them can compare with me. I am the king of this water and
    I stand up tall in this shallow well. I’m perfectly happy. My
    dear Sir Turtle, why don’t you come and take a look at my
    place?”
    The turtle from the East Sea agreed. However, before he
    could get his left foot in the well, his right knee got stuck.
    The turtle hesitated and moved back.
    Then, the turtle told the frog about the East Sea where he
    lived.
    “Even a distance of a thousand kilometres cannot give you
    an idea of the sea’s width. Even a height of a thousand
    kilometres cannot give you an idea of its depth. In the time
    of King Yu of the Xia Dynasty, there were floods nine
    years out of ten, but the waters in the sea did not
    increase.”
    “In the time of King Tang of the Shang dynasty,” continued
    the turtle, “there were droughts seven years out of eight,
    but the waters in the sea did not decrease. The sea does
    not change with the passage of time and its level does not
    rise or fall according to the amount of rain that falls. The
    greatest happiness is to live in the East Sea.”
    After listening to these words, the frog that lived in the
    shallow well was shocked. He realized how insignificant
    he was.
    He watched sadly as the turtle slowly made his way back
    to the waters of the Great East Sea.

    The Dancer
    Though she was about to go on stage, she wasn’t
    nervous. She knew that she was the best. She knew that
    she would win the competition and amaze the judges with
    her skills.
    She bowed and began. She was perfect. Her lines, jumps,
    and twirls all amazed the judges. But then it happened.
    She was about to complete her big jump. She came down
    on her foot and it turned to one side. She felt a terrible
    pain and collapsed on the ground. She had broken a bone
    in her foot.
    It was a terrible thing for Melanie. She had to have surgery
    on her foot, and the doctors thought she would never
    dance again.
    At the hospital, she met a man named Neil who could not
    walk at all. They became friends.
    One day, Melanie said to him, “If I can’t be the best, I don’t
    want to be a dancer.” This made Neil angry. “Do you know
    what I would do to be able to dance?” he asked. She
    realized that it had been a foolish and hurtful thing to say
    to a man who would never walk. He wheeled away in his
    wheelchair.
    Months passed and Melanie went to another audition.
    She was terrified.
    Then she saw him. Neil was in the audience! She was not
    fearful anymore. She jumped. She leaped. She amazed
    the audience. She danced for Neil.
    At the end, one of the judges said, “This past year was
    difficult for you, but it has made you a more humble
    person, and that will make you a better dancer. Welcome
    to our school!”
    Melanie smiled and cried as she recalled her journey over
    the last year. She was so thankful for meeting Neil. She
    was amazed to think how that broken bone in her foot
    could make such a huge difference in her life.
    If not for that accident, she would never have met Neil.
    And as for Neil, he never missed a chance to see his
    favourite sight in the world the sight of Melanie dancing.

    The Silver Pine Cones
    (adapted from a German folk tale)
    Long ago, there lived a man with his wife and children.
    Misfortune came to the family when the man fell ill and
    could not work. Soon, there was hunger in the house. To
    make matters worse, they had no wood for fire to warm
    their house.
    One day, the wife announced that she was going to the
    forest to search for pine cones. She dreamed of gathering
    enough to sell at the market and buy food for her family.
    With a basket in hand, she began to gather cones.
    Thinking about her misery, she began to cry. Suddenly, a
    small man with white hair and a beard appeared. “Who
    are you?” he asked with anger. “And why are you stealing
    my pine cones?”
    The wife fell to her knees and apologized to the strange
    little man. “I am so sorry,” she exclaimed. “I should not be
    stealing your cones.” She explained the cause of her
    sadness. The man listened and gently said, “You must
    leave my cones here, but go further to the next grove of
    trees. The pine cones there are much better.”
    The woman did as she was told. When she got there, she
    was tired and sat to rest a moment. Suddenly, pine cones
    fell from the trees, filling her basket to the brim. The
    frightened woman ran all the way home, the basket
    growing heavy as she ran.
    Upon arriving home, she discovered why. The pine cones
    had turned to silver!
    The woman went to the market and sold some of the
    precious silver cones. She purchased food and everything
    the family needed. The children ate well, but her sick
    husband could not eat.
    The woman returned to the forest, found the little man,
    and thanked him with all her heart. “It is my pleasure,”
    replied the man. Then, he gave her a leaf from a forest
    plant. “Cook this and give it to your sick husband,” he
    instructed. The woman did as she was told, and her
    husband soon became healthy.
    The family had all they needed for the rest of their lives. In
    honour of the strange little man’s kindness, they kept one
    of the silver cones. And every day, they thanked him for
    his kindness.

    The Good Samaritan
    Quoc Thyungen is a 40-year-old Vietnamese Canadian.
    His story really inspires me. He came to Canada as a
    refugee with his family when he was just a three-year-old
    boy. There was a war in his country, and his parents
    wanted to move to a place where they could raise their
    children in peace and safety.
    Quoc grew up just like any normal Canadian boy. He went
    to school, played sports, and did well in university. When
    he graduated, he opened a restaurant. He was very
    successful. But something was missing in his life. He
    didn’t really feel happy, although he had all the money he
    could ever wish for.
    One summer, he went on a trip to Vietnam. When he
    arrived in Hanoi, he saw many young boys living on the
    streets. They had no one to care for them. As he spoke
    with them, he realized how little they had and how much
    he had been given in his life.
    He felt a strong need to do something big. He sat in his
    hotel room and thought about it. What could he do to help
    these forgotten and unloved street kids? He knew that
    giving them money was not enough. He knew that a hand-
    out would not really change their lives. He thought about
    his own life and all the people who had extended a helping
    hand to him so that he could help himself.
    Now, he knew what to do.
    He bought a small building in downtown Hanoi and
    converted it into a restaurant for tourists. It served
    Vietnamese and Western-style food. He hired only street
    kids to work there. He taught some of them to cook, others
    to work with the cash, and others to wait on tables. It
    became a very successful business.
    So far, more than 75 boys who had been living without
    hope on the dangerous streets of Hanoi have learned a
    skill. Best of all, they earned their own money and no
    longer had to beg for it from strangers.
    And you know what? Quoc says that helping these kids
    has helped him find what was missing in his life
