The Strange Goose
Susan lives on a farm. There are always lots of animals
around. The geese are her favourites.
One day, the mother goose disappeared. But there was
one egg left in the nest. Susan wanted to take care of it.
She took a box and made a warm place for the egg in the
box.
She kept the egg very warm. Soon, a small crack formed
in the egg. And then, another crack formed.
Finally, a small, yellow baby goose stuck its head out.
Susan could not believe it!
The baby goose ate and ate. It grew big. It followed her
everywhere.
One day, everyone in Susan’s school heard a sound
outside. When they looked out the window, they all
laughed.
Susan’s goose had followed her to school!

Getting Up Early
My bed was wonderful. My pillow was perfect. My blanket
was soft and warm. I was having a sweet sleep.
All of a sudden, my alarm clock rang. I was still sleepy. But
I knew it was time to get up.
It was not easy to pull myself out of my comfortable bed,
especially at six in the morning.
But then, I remembered what I was going to do.
So I shook my head and stretched my arms, I was
completely awake.
Wondering why I got up so early? It was the first practice
for our hockey team. We were meeting at the ice rink of
our local community centre.
You see, an indoor ice rink has to be shared by many
people. Our team was scheduled for the first session,
which was early in the morning.
It’s hard to get up early, but I like to play hockey, I love
team sports. So for me, getting up early is worth it.

Zebras
Zebras are unique-looking animals that live in Africa. They
look like horses, but they are not horses.
How can you tell a horse from a zebra? It’s easy!
If it’s covered with black and white stripes, it’s definitely a
zebra. Sometimes, when zebras stand together, their
stripes look confusing. This helps protect them from other
animals that want to eat them, like lions and cheetahs.
Zebras collect in large groups called herds. A herd can
have more than one thousand zebras in it. This is another
way zebras protect themselves from animals that like to
eat them.
Within a large herd, zebras have family groups. A zebra
family is made up of a father zebra, several mother
zebras, and their young.
Zebras are very fast. They can run up to 56 kilometres per
hour. This also helps them get away from animals that like
to eat them.
To us, all zebras look alike. But, they are not all alike.
Each and every zebra has its own unique pattern of
stripes. They really are one of a kind.

The Best Ride Ever
The hill looked big. But Tommy and Sally wanted to get to
the top. They weren’t sure if they would make it all the way
up. But they still wanted to try.
Together, they pulled the sled. Halfway up the hill, they
took a rest in the snow. Then, they pulled and pushed the
sled farther up the hill.
The cold wind blew hard, and the snow was slippery. But
they were almost there. So they kept climbing.
Finally, they got to the top of the hill. They turned the sled
around. Tommy sat in the front. Sally sat in the back. The
fluffy snow on the hill sparkled in the sunshine.
“Are you ready?” asked Tommy. “Yes!” said Sally. She
pushed off on the snow.
The sled slipped over the top of the hill and raced to the
bottom.
“That was the best ride ever!” said Tommy and Sally
together.
“Let’s do it again!”

Not A Toy Truck
Do you like to play with trucks? Many boys do. Some girls
do too.
How would you like to play with a truck that is the size of a
two-storey house?
Am I serious? Yes. These trucks are called mining trucks
and they carry rocks and dirt from underground.
One of these trucks weighs about as much as ten big
houses. If you put five houses on top of each other, the
truck would be able to carry them.
The truck is so big that the driver has to climb a ladder to
get into it. And the tires are taller than a basketball net!
Now that is a truck! But it would be hard to put it into your
closet when your mom tells you to clean your room!
11-7
How Fast Are You?
Do you think you are a fast runner? How fast can you run?
You may be fast for a person, but no one is as fast as
some animals.
For example, a cheetah can run up to 110 kilometres per
hour. A horse can run almost 90. And a rabbit can run
about 60. Even a wart hog can go as fast as 50 kilometres
per hour!
The fastest human once ran at a speed of about 45
kilometres per hour. That was for the 100-yard dash at the
Olympics.
Now, the fastest man alive is Asafa Powell, a sprinter from
Jamaica. He ran 100 metres in 9.77 seconds. That’s about
10 metres per second or 36.8 kilometres per hour!
That’s just a little faster than an elephant!
Feeling slow? Well, don’t feel bad because humans can
outrun snakes, chickens and mice.
Just don’t try to race a cheetah.

Gathering for Winter
Two brother squirrels, Fred and Ned, needed to fill the
hollow of their tree with acorns.
Ned watched Fred stuff one acorn into each cheek and
hurry off to their tree with only two acorns.
Ned wanted to collect more acorns than Fred.
He stuffed one acorn into each cheek and one under each
arm. He then put another acorn between his knees and
another under his chin. He could hardly move, but he
managed to balance another acorn on his head.
Slowly, he walked towards their tree. He felt so proud of
himself, thinking that Fred was so silly to carry only two
acorns at a time.
It was evening when Ned finally arrived back at their tree
with his load of seven acorns. He was sure that he had
brought home more acorns than Fred until he tried putting
his acorns into the hollow of the tree.
There was no room! Fred had filled it up to the top -- just
two acorns at a time.

A Dumpling Party
One day, Lucy’s grandma hurt her ankle. So she had to sit
in a chair all day.
“Soon you will be able to walk around with a cane,” the
doctor told her. “But for now, I want you to keep the weight
off your ankle.”
Everyone in the family wanted to help Grandma. They
thought and thought.
Suddenly, Lucy had an idea. She told her mother about
her plan. Together, they went to the store and bought what
they needed. Then, they drove to Grandma’s house.
“We came to have a dumpling party with you!” Lucy told
her grandma, “I know that dumplings are your favourite
food. Today we are going to make many different kinds of
dumplings.”
Lucy and her mom worked hard for an hour and made lots
of dumplings.
Then, they boiled some water and cooked the dumplings.
Soon, everyone was enjoying a big bowl of steaming hot
dumplings.
Best of all, Lucy’s grandma wasn’t sad anymore. She was
smiling.

Playing in the Crowd
(based on a traditional Chinese story)
Long ago in China, there lived a king who was very fond of
music. His favourite pastime was listening to his musicians
play a Chinese instrument called the Yu.
The king often put hundreds of players together to perform
grand music. And he treated his musicians very well.
A man named Nanguo did not know how to play the
instrument. But he really wanted to be treated to the king’s
grand meals. So he found a way to join the king’s band.
Whenever the band played for the king, Nanguo just stood
there and pretended to play like the others. Nobody knew
that he was making no sound at all. After the concerts, he
always enjoyed eating and drinking with everyone else.
Eventually, the king died and his son became the new
king.
Although the new king also liked music, he wanted
something different. He ordered the musicians to play one
by one, rather than all together.
Upon hearing the news, Nanguo fled the palace
immediately.

The Shoe Lady
There once was a woman who loved shoes very much.
People called her the “shoe lady”. She bought shoes all
the time. Once, she counted all her shoes and found that
she had almost one hundred pairs!
One day, she met an old man who was well known for his
wisdom. The lady told the old man that she loved
shopping for shoes. She just could not stop.
If she bought one more pair, she would have 100 pairs of
shoes!
The old man laughed when he heard the number. He said,
“You are not a centipede! You know, the insect with many
legs and feet?”
The old man continued, “You have only two legs and two
feet. Why do you need so many shoes?” The woman
couldn’t answer.
The old man said, “Owning a lot of shoes doesn’t make
you a better person. It only costs you more. Why don’t you
try to help someone in need? You will see if that makes
you happy.”

Fingernails
“OUCH!” cries Sammy. “That hurts.” She just hit her finger
with a hammer while trying to hang a picture on the wall.
Sammy feels an ache in her finger. Every time her heart
beats, she feels the pain. So her father takes her to the
doctor.
The doctor looks at Sammy’s finger. He says, “That must
hurt. There are a lot of little nerves in your fingers. Nerves
tell your brain when something hurts. Fingers are VERY
sensitive to pain.”
Sammy is a smart little girl. She thinks about it for a
minute. Then she says, “Doctor Jones, why does it hurt
when I hit my finger, but it does not hurt when I cut my
fingernails?”
The doctor smiles. “Good question,” he says. “Your
fingernails are there at the end of your fingers. But they
are not your fingers. Fingernails do not have nerves. They
cannot feel anything.”
Sammy smiles. She thinks she knows the answer, but
asks anyway, “So is that why my hair doesn’t hurt when I
cut it?”

Leaning Tower of Pizza?
What? The leaning tower of pizza?
Well, not really. But it’s easy to mistake the word Pisa for
pizza.
Pisa is a lovingly city in Italy. And pizza is something we
love to eat.
In the year 1173, a bell tower was built in the city of Pisa. It
was an amazing thing. But, as soon as they were done
building it, the tower started to lean.
Since then, this building has been leaning a little bit more
each year.
Today, very strong steel is used to help hold it up. The
tower still leans, but it is very safe.
People come from around the world to see the famous
Leaning Tower of Pisa… and also to eat Italian pizza!

Festival of Tulips
For two weeks every spring, there is a special celebration
in the city where I live. It’s called the Tulip Festival.
Like the name suggests, this festival brings millions of
blossoming tulips in every shape and colour.
Thousands of people from all over the city come to see
this special event. As you can imagine, it’s a beautiful
sight.
I remember, as a young child, going to the park with my
grandmother every spring to see the tulips. To this day,
those memories stick in my mind as some of the most
amazing moments of my life.
It’s hard to believe, but this year marked the 59th Tulip
Festival! That’s a lot of tulips over the years!
Oh, do you want to know another reason why I love this
festival so much? It’s a sign that summer is coming!

As Brave as a Lion (I)
(based on an African legend)
Long ago, in Africa, a woman was afraid that her husband
no longer loved her. So she visited the local wise man.
After listening to her story, the wise man said, “If you want
to leave your husband, I will help you. But if you still love
him, I can give you a magic drink. This potion will make
him love you forever.”
The woman cried, “Give me this magic potion now, for I
want to keep my husband.” The man said. “I have
everything I need except for one important ingredient. I am
too old to get it myself. You will have to bring it to me.”
The woman said, “Sure. But what is it?”
“I need one whisker from a living lion,” said the old man.
The woman was afraid. “How will I be able to get it?”
thought the woman. But her love for her husband was
great.
The next day, she went to the river where all the lions
drank. She put some meat on the ground and hid in the
bushes.
Soon, a big, scary lion appeared. He sniffed the air
suspiciously, but took the meat. Then, he had a drink of
water and left.
11-16
As Brave as a Lion (II)
(based on an African legend)
Each day, the woman returned to the river, put the meat
on the ground and hid. And each day, the lion arrived and
ate the meat.
After a week, the woman slowly crept out from behind the
bushes as the lion ate. The lion did not notice her. The
woman carefully reached out and plucked a whisker from
the lion.
The lion continued to eat as if nothing had happened. The
woman sat very still until the lion left. Then, she ran as fast
as she could to the home of the wise man.
When she brought him the whisker, he was amazed. “I
can make the potion for you,” he said. “But you do not
need it. Your actions show how brave you are. They show
how much you love your husband. You risked your life for
him. Go home and show your husband how lucky he is.”
You know what? The woman did as the wise man said,
and she and her husband lived a long and happy life
together.

A Good Word
Words are powerful things. They can start wars. They can
also end wars. They can begin lifelong friendships and
end them.
Words are not solid like bricks and stone, but they can be
just as strong.
Some people argue about some things and never speak
again. Words destroy their friendship.
Some people stay together a whole lifetime because of
words.
So, be careful choosing your words. One word can hurt
someone for a lifetime. But a word of support at the right
time can change a life!
Words can be used as weapons or as tools to build
bridges. Try saying things like, “Hey, that was a good job!”
or “Thanks for helping me with my math.” Little things can
make a huge difference.
Always remember, one good word is worth more than a
thousand words that hurt. And be careful how you use
words. They have a lot of power.

Don’t Forget!
My brother is very forgetful. Actually, he forgets things all
the time.
Recently, he came back from Italy. To no one’s surprise,
he forgot something on the trip.
What did he forget? His suit jacket. That’s the jacket he
wears for all of his business trips!
After an eight-hour flight from Italy, my brother’s plane
landed at the airport. All of sudden, he felt very light. He
felt like something was missing.
“Oh, no!” He realized that he didn’t have his jacket with
him. He felt mad at himself. He called the hotel right away.
Luckily, a lady at the hotel answered and went to check his
room. A few minutes later, she told him that she had found
his jacket in the room’s closet.
Feeling relieved, my brother went to get a taxi. But you
know what? He forgot something else.
What was it this time? His laptop. He had left it in the
airport where he had made the phone call!
That’s just the way my brother is. He’s forgetful... and
lucky!

Building Guitars
My mom makes guitars. Her father showed her how to
build guitars when she was young. It is not easy.
It takes about one month for her to build just one guitar.
But each guitar is very special. The person who buys it is
very lucky because the guitar was made just for him or
her. There isn’t another one like it in the whole world.
My mom has been making guitars for more than 20 years.
But her father built guitars for nearly 50 years.
My mom asked me if I would like to learn how to build
guitars too. But I’m not interested in that. I like playing
guitars. When I get older, I hope my mom will build one for
me.

A Perfect Smile
When you go to the dentist, sometimes you get good
news, and sometimes you get bad news. But one day, I
got the worst news of all. I needed braces!
My dentist is great. She is one of those people with a
naturally perfect smile. And she smiles all the time.
I am not one of those people. My teeth are not straight.
They are crooked. I’m embarrassed to smile. I always try
to smile with my mouth closed.
That day, I sat in the dentist’s chair feeling bad about the
news. I didn’t want to wear braces. Then, my dentist
showed me a picture of a little girl about my age. Her teeth
were worse than mine.
“What do you think about her teeth?” she asked me. “Is
she one of your patients?” I asked. Then, she smiled with
her perfect smile and said, “That’s a picture of me.”
I looked at the picture and then at her perfect teeth. “When
can we start?” I asked with a big grin.
11-21
Volcanoes
There are thousands of volcanoes all over the world. They
hiss and boil, and sometimes they explode.
Volcanoes are a force of nature, both beautiful and
dangerous. They can be found on land and on the ocean
floor as well.
The country with the most volcanoes is Indonesia. The
Pacific Ocean is surrounded by many volcanoes. People
call it the “ring of fire”.
When a volcano erupts, gas and molten rock shoot out of
the top. This can be very dangerous.
Most of the time, a volcano is a mountain. This is because,
when it erupts, rock and ash are left behind.
That’s why volcanoes usually grow taller each time they
erupt.
Some volcanoes are active and others are asleep.
Volcanoes are very powerful and dangerous. But from a
safe distance, they can also be very beautiful.
11-22
Nature’s Way
We all know that working with nature is better than
working against it.
Just think of maple syrup, for example.
Maple syrup comes from maple trees. It is made from the
sap (the fluid) inside the trees. The problem is that the sap
is like blood for a tree. A tree needs sap to live.
A long time ago, people took too much sap from the trees.
They made so many holes in the trunks that the trees
died.
Later, people learned to work with the trees without killing
them. The trees could stay healthy and still produce lots of
sap for maple syrup. Today, we use little pumps to get the
sap out of the trees.
They work so well that some trees have been producing
sap for 150 years! It takes a lot of sap to make maple
syrup. For just one litre of syrup, you need 30 to 40 litres
of sap!
So, if we take care of nature, it will share many treasures
with us.

Lucky, the Hero
My cat’s name is Lucky. She is black and white. Her eyes
are green. She is the best cat in the whole world.
My dad used to say that our cat was lucky to live with a
family like us. That is why we call her Lucky.
But one night, we learned that we are even luckier than
Lucky.
That night, while all of us were sleeping, a small fire
started in our house. The deadly smoke and carbon
monoxide gas filled our home. In a few hours, we would all
have been dead.
That’s when Lucky went upstairs to my parents’ room. She
started to meow and scream loudly. She jumped on my
father until he woke up.
Luckily, we were able to call the fire department for help.
Our whole family survived.
Thank you, Lucky. You are an amazing cat! You are our
hero!

Texas Surprise
I live in Montreal with my family. But, my dad often has to
travel to Texas for work. In the winter, there is a lot of snow
where I live. Texas is too warm for snow.
One night, Dad called from Texas. “Guess what?” he said.
“There is a snowstorm here. People are having so much
fun. Most of them have never seen snow before!”
“They are sliding down hills. They are throwing snowballs.
They are building snowmen. They even closed all the
schools for the day. All this because of 5 centimetres of
snow!”
Dad also explained how the snow could be dangerous.
He said that people in Texas didn’t know how to drive in
the snow because they were not used to it.
While we were talking, I heard, “Acheww!” And then again,
“Aaaacheeeewwww!”
“What’s wrong, Dad?” I asked.
“They don’t have heaters in the rooms here,” he said. “It’s
freezing!”
I could not believe it. Poor Dad was freezing in Texas
while I was nice and warm here in Canada!

The Long Wire
I live in Canada. One evening, my elderly aunt called me
from England. We were both using cellphones.
“This little cellphone is amazing!” she said.
“Why?” I asked.
“Well, when I was a little girl, all phones were connected
by wires. In 1930, a wire was laid between Europe and
North America. That wire allowed people on two
continents to connect by phone for the first time.
“It was laid on the bottom of the ocean,” she said. “Just
imagine… a wire about 4,000 kilometres long! Isn’t it
amazing?” said my aunt.
“Yes, it is. I never thought about it before,” I said.
My aunt continued, “But I’m more amazed that this little
cellphone allows me talk to anyone in the world without a
wire!”
When we hung up, I looked at my little cellphone. She was
right. It was amazing.
11-26
The King and the Pawn
I love chess. It is hard, but it is also fun. The goal is to take
the other person’s pieces until you capture their king.
These pieces move on a big board that has coloured
squares on it.
There are many pieces: a king and a queen, two bishops,
two knights, and two rooks. All these pieces can jump in
specific directions.
There are also eight pawns. Usually, they can move only
one square at a time.
Pawns are not the most powerful pieces. But, they can
protect the bigger and more important players.
I feel sorry for the pawns. They usually get taken first.
But I have also seen a pawn become the last player left to
defend the king.
Just like in real life, you don’t have to be big and powerful
to make a difference.
11-27
Hothouse Tomatoes
Every year at Christmas, people buy gifts for friends and
relatives. Most people buy gifts from stores.
But Mr. Wang is different. He sends people gifts from his
farm. He sends them hothouse tomatoes.
Tomatoes normally grow in the summer. But hothouse
tomatoes grow in the cooler months too. A hothouse is a
heated building made of glass. It’s used to grow plants in
colder temperatures than usual.
Mr. Wang’s daughter did not think tomatoes made good
gifts.
“They are too simple,’’ she said. “Nothing fancy at all.” But
Mr. Wang did not agree. He said, “You will see if people
like these tomatoes.”
At his insistence, his daughter packed and sent boxes of
fresh tomatoes to friends and relatives.
Soon, Mr. Wang began to receive phone calls about the
tomatoes. People were actually very pleased with the
gifts. They enjoyed eating the delicious tomatoes out of
season.

Doll Clothes
Two sisters, Mary and Betty, went to a yard sale looking
for something special. Their mother had given each of
them some money to spend and they felt very rich.
Mary and Betty went from table to table, looking at all the
different things.
Suddenly, they both saw something they wanted. It was a
box of doll clothes. The trouble was that they both wanted
the same thing.
“How much is that box of doll clothes?” Mary asked the
lady.
“Three dollars,” the lady told her. It was more than Mary
had. It was more money than Betty had too.
Suddenly, Betty got an idea.
“You don’t have enough money. And I don’t have enough
money either. But, if we put our money together, we will
have just enough,” she told her sister. “Why don’t we buy
them together and share them?”
And so they did.
The two sisters went home happy with a box of colourful
doll clothes.

Small, Big and Tall
What’s the world’s smallest bird? Well, you’ll have to go all
the way to Cuba to see it. But it might be worth it.
It’s a bee hummingbird. And it is REALLY small. It’s only 7
centimetres long, you’d better have good eyes to spot it.
What about the tallest bird? It’s a crane. And unless you
are a basketball player, you won’t be nearly as tall as it.
How tall are some cranes? Cranes can be 2 metres tall.
That’s really tall for a bird!
Do you think only small birds can fly? Well, think again.
The Kori Bustard can fly, but it can also weigh up to 20
kilograms! You’ll have to travel all the way to parts of Asia
and Africa to see one.
Some things in nature really make you think.
11-30
Born to Fly
I love to watch birds fly. They soar in the sky. Sometimes,
they dive down and then swoop back up without even
flapping their wings!
I know that one day I will fly an airplane.
I love to read about planes and learn about them. They
are beautiful. They are fast -- faster than any bird! And
they can fly higher than any bird too.
But no plane is as beautiful as a bird. Birds make beautiful
sounds. They tweet and chirp. They sit by my back
window and I feed them.
They have become my good friends.
One day, I will learn to fly. But I know that no plane can do
what birds can do, for birds were born to fly.
