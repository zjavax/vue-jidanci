    She took a deep breath.<br />
    Bang!<br />
    Her trunk flew open.<br />
    Balloons flew out!<br />
    Honk! Honk!<br />
    Poppy tooted her horn.<br />
    Eddy laughed hard.<br />
    His dumper shook.<br />
    “What’s your name?” asked Poppy.<br />
    Eddy told her.<br />
    Two trucks rolled over.<br />
    “Eddy,” said Poppy.<br />
    “Meet Dipper and Jeb.”<br />
    “I’m an ice cream truck,” said Dipper.<br />
    “I play music.”<br />
    “I move dirt,” said Jeb.<br />
    He rolled off the lot.<br />
    He scooped some dirt.<br />
    “Hey, Eddy,” said Jeb.<br />
    “Want to carry this dirt?”<br />
    “No, thanks,” said Eddy.<br />
    “I don’t like to carry dirt.”<br />
    Everyone looked surprised.<br />
    “What do you like to do?” asked Dipper.<br />
    Eddy grinned.<br />
    “I like to race!”<br />
    <br />
    Tire Town School 3: The Race<br />
    “You like to race?” said Dipper.<br />
    “You must be fast, Eddy!”<br />
    Eddy frowned.<br />
    “I’m slow,” he said.<br />
    “I just wish I was fast.”<br />
    “I bet you’re fast,” said Dipper.<br />
    “Let’s all race!”<br />
    “Okay,” said Eddy.<br />
    “Yay!” said Poppy.<br />
    “This will be fun,” said Jeb.<br />
    Everyone lined up.<br />
    Poppy looked at everyone.<br />
    “Ready, set . . .”<br />
    Honk! Honk!<br />
    Eddy took off.<br />
    Dipper played music.<br />
    Jeb rolled slowly.<br />
    Poppy drove through a puddle.<br />
    “Woo-hoo!” cried Poppy.<br />
    She drove through the puddle again.<br />
    Eddy won!<br />
    “Yay!” His friends cheered.<br />
    “You’re fast!” they said.<br />
    A race car drove over.<br />
    He had fancy stripes.<br />
    “You’re not fast,” said the car.<br />
    “You’re just a slow dump truck!”<br />
    <br />

    “You’re mean, Zippy,” said Dipper.<br />
    “Eddy is fast,” said Jeb.<br />
    “He won our race,” said Poppy.<br />
    “Eddy is not fast,” said Zippy.<br />
    “He won because you’re all slow!”<br />
    Eddy felt sad.<br />
    “I’m fast!” said Zippy.<br />
    He zoomed off.<br />
    Vroom! Vroom!<br />
    Zippy turned left.<br />
    He turned right.<br />
    “Wow,” thought Eddy.<br />
    Crash!<br />
    Zippy hit a wall.<br />
    Something rolled across the lot.<br />
    “My wheel!” cried Zippy.<br />
    “I can’t drive now!”<br />
    Zippy looked sad.<br />
    “I’ll help,” said Eddy.<br />
    “Me too,” said Jeb.<br />
    Jeb picked up Zippy’s wheel.<br />
    He put it in Eddy’s dumper.<br />
    Eddy carried the wheel to Zippy.<br />
    “Thanks,” said Zippy.<br />
    “Eddy, let’s race again!” called Poppy.<br />
    Eddy smiled.<br />
    Zippy was mean.<br />
