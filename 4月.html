Every year when spring arrives, my father announces it’s
time to visit our uncle’s sugar forest. This year, I invited my
good friend Jasmine.
“To a sugar forest?” she asked. “Is there really a forest
where sugar grows?” Her questions were funny, but I
understood her confusion. She’s from Africa. They don’t
have maple trees there. And you need maple trees to
make maple sugar.
“Well, not exactly,” I explained. “But there is a certain kind
of tree used to make sugar. It’s called a maple tree.”
That spring Saturday morning, Jasmine and I were very
excited. You could almost hear the snow melting. As we
drove along, Dad told Jasmine about maple sugar.
“In Canada, for a few weeks in spring, maple trees send a
special liquid up from their roots to the top of the trees.
This liquid is called sap. It’s 98 percent water. The
remaining two percent is a natural sugar,” Dad explained.
“To make maple sugar, you make a small hole in the trunk
of a maple tree and catch the sap. You then boil the sap.
The water evaporates, leaving a sweet syrup. If you boil it
long enough, it turns into brown sugar. Very sweet and
very good to eat!”
When we arrived, my uncle was making maple sugar in a
big pot over a big fire. You could see the steam rising as
the water evaporated. My father pitched in and helped.
Jasmine and I just sat and learned. By the end of the day,
there were big cans of sweet maple syrup and sugar.
What Jasmine really loved was when my uncle put some
hot syrup on the snow and it turned to candy. As we ate
our maple candy, we walked in the forest, stopping to look
in the buckets that my uncle had hung on the trees to
catch the sap.
Jasmine was laughing. “I can hardly wait to tell my
grandparents in Africa about this,” she said. “I can’t
imagine what Grandfather will say when I tell him I spent
the day in a sugar forest!”

Learning a Lesson
I’m good in school. I do my work and study a lot, but for
some reason, I have a very bad habit of losing things.
Last summer, I was on vacation with my family at the
beach. On the first day, my father gave me a watch to
replace the one I had lost the year before. “You need to
have a watch, so take good care of this one,” he said.
The next day, I went swimming. The sun was shining on
the water. The water was warm and beautiful. I swam.
I floated. I treaded water and I dove. I really enjoyed being
in the water.
By the time I returned to shore, I was exhausted so I lay
down. At that moment, I remembered my watch and
looked to see what time it was. But it was gone! I
searched all afternoon, but I could not find it.
That night at dinner, I arrived with my sleeves pulled
down, hoping no one would notice that I didn’t have my
watch.
My sister asked, “What time is it?”
“Ask Tom,” my mother said. “He has the fancy new watch.”
Dad looked at me and said, “Don’t tell me that you’ve lost
the watch already!”
“No!” I said. I was sweating with panic. I knew I was going
to be caught in a terrible lie. Just then, there was an
announcement: “Ladies and gentlemen, a very nice watch
was found on the beach today. If you lost one and can
identify it, please come to the front desk.”
Immediately, I knew what I had to do. I slowly got up, with
my whole family staring at me. I went to the desk. There it
was. The watch was not scratched. It was still working.
I walked back to the table and sat down. Everyone was
frowning, but then my Dad smiled. He knew that I had
finally learned my lesson.

Making a Difference
We have a friend who helps out homeless people, you
know, those unfortunate people who live on the street.
Every weekend during our cold winter, he brings hot tasty
soup to people who live outdoors.
He is a very successful man. His name is Richard. He
makes a lot of money and drives a very nice car.
One weekend, he called our house and asked us kids if
we would come to his place. He calls it his “soup kitchen”.
It’s a small place downtown, close to where the homeless
people live. We were a little scared but we said okay. We
spent most of the day serving soup to people of all ages,
both old and young.
After the meal, everyone sat down and listened to Richard
talk about how to go back to school and how to get a job.
He helps people get jobs and he’s always supportive of
them.
On the way home that evening, Richard told us that it
made him feel good to help the homeless. He wanted to
know how we felt about doing it. I said that it made me feel
good too, especially since I know these people really need
a helping hand.
Richard told us that a lot of people think homeless people
are lazy and should not live on the street. However,
Richard feels that people live on the street for many
different and complicated reasons. And once someone
starts living on the street, it’s difficult for them to get off it.
He said that he knew one kid who got off the street, went
back to school and became a pretty successful man. He
smiled and asked, “Would you like to meet him?”
I said, “Sure.”
He grabbed my hand, shook it and said, “Nice to meet
you!” I could hardly believe it. I said, “You mean you...?” I
was speechless, really.
I’m very proud to know Richard. He is just one person, but
one person really can make a difference.

Chicks Hatching (I)
Ever since I learned about my aunt’s new chicken
hatchery, I was extremely anxious to go see the little
chicks hatching. In my mind, I pictured the new little
creatures pecking out of their shells and spreading their
wings for the first time!
I finally got my chance in the summer when my family
went to visit my aunt.
The moment we arrived, I jumped out of the car and ran
towards my aunt.
“Aunt, I really, really want to see little chicks coming out of
the eggs. Can I, can I? Please!” I begged.
“Sure, that’s possible. But it’s not as simple as you think.
Are you sure you’re ready for it?” my aunt asked as she
looked at me smiling.
“Of course, just tell me what to do!”
As it turned out, things in the chicken barn were not
exactly as I had imagined. In the hatchery, the eggs are
not hatched by hens sitting on them. Instead, they are
hatched in big ovens called incubators, hundreds at a
time.
Eggs are loaded into trays and put into the oven, where
they spend exactly sixteen days at a very precise
temperature. Raising new chicks from eggs is truly an
exact science. Everything must be planned right down to
the smallest detail. By the due time, when the door is
opened again, all the eggs will have turned into chicks!
Unfortunately, I couldn’t see the process that day. My aunt
told me I would have to wait one week for the next batch
to come. This would be next Sunday at 5:00 a.m.
I was a bit disappointed, but as with most things in life, the
best experiences are worth waiting for. Sure, this will be
well worth the wait,” I thought to myself.
That night as I lay in bed, I could not contain my
excitement. In only seven days, I would return to my aunt’s
chicken farm to watch a new brood of chicks being born.

Chicks Hatching (II)
Waking up at 4:00 in the morning was much harder than I
thought! However, when I remembered what I was going
to do that morning, I struggled to get dressed quickly so
that I would not miss the chance to go to the hatchery with
my aunt and uncle.
The moment I entered the incubator room, all my
sleepiness evaporated. The smell was absolutely horrible!
As five adults hastily prepared the bins that would hold the
newborn chicks, I quickly put on a mask and a hat. There
were only a few minutes left until the incubator doors were
to be opened. I could hear the chirping sounds from the
chicks that had already hatched. It seemed as if they were
cheering their buddies on, motivating them to break
through their shells faster!
As the minutes passed, the chirping became louder and
louder. Finally, a technician opened the incubator doors. In
front of my eyes were rows upon rows of little chicks and
broken egg shells. They were literally steaming hot! Every
one of them was full of energy -- moving, spinning around,
and chirping with all of its strength.
All the adults were fast at work while I stared in awe.
First, the male and female chicks were separated into
different bins. To do this, the technician examined the tips
of the wings. Roosters have darker, separated wing tips.
The wing tips of hens are fluffy and pale. Next, the chicks
were given an injection to boost their immune systems.
The entire process took three hours. By the time all the
chicks were immunized, the sun had already come up.
The vans set out to deliver the chicks to chicken farms,
sometimes twenty or more kilometres away. They had to
deliver the chicks before the day got too hot. Otherwise,
the birds would have less chance of surviving.
When all the vans had departed in various directions, my
aunt took a deep breath. She could relax now that the
baby chicks were on the way to their new homes.

A Strange Hobby
A happy child has a hobby. That’s what my mom always
says. My hobby is studying the night sky. My sister’s
hobby is skateboarding. Many people around us have
hobbies too. Some hobbies are ordinary like ours. But
some people have very weird hobbies.
A friend of mine collects rocks. Everywhere he goes, he
stops and looks at rocks. If he finds an interesting one, he
takes it home and adds it to his collection. His mom says
that he has to stop soon because his room is getting full of
rocks.
My mom’s best friend collects salt and pepper shakers.
But not just any salt and pepper shakers. They have to
have something to do with bears. They can have a picture
of a bear or be shaped like a bear -- it doesn’t matter, as
long as it is a salt and pepper shaker with a bear on them
somewhere.
I learned about a weird hobby when I was in Germany last
year.
While I was on a train, I saw a guy reading a book.
I recognized the title, so I said to the guy, “That is a good
book. I really enjoyed reading it.” He said, “Yes, it is a
good book. But I’m reading it for a very special reason.
You can see that it has a green cover. My hobby is
collecting books with green covers.” That’s a strange
hobby.
I had a good conversation with him. He told me that he
had more than one hundred books, all with green covers.
He said that it was very hard to find books with green
covers. Green was not a colour that publishers liked to
use on book covers. He spent a lot of time in bookstores.
He read a book, and if it was good AND if the cover was
green, he added it to his collection. His dream was to have
one wall in his house with only green books on it.
Strange, you might say. But it’s his hobby. And as Mom
always says, “A happy child has a hobby.”
What’s your hobby?

A Small Gift
There once was a young man who had just graduated
from university. He was hoping to get a very nice gift from
his parents.
When he graduated from high school, he got a watch.
So he expected that his university gift would be even
bigger. He was hoping that he might even get a car. Even
an old, used car would be perfect. He gave many hints to
his parents about it.
The day of his graduation finally came. That night, his
father called the young man into the living room. He said,
“Son, you know how I would read you stories you’re your
favourite book when you were a little boy? Well, it took me
days of searching, but I finally found that book. I’ve got it
cleaned, fixed up and a new cover put on it. Maybe one
day you can give it to your son.”
The father had a tear in his eye as he hugged his son.
The young man, who loved his father very much, suddenly
felt horrible. He could see that he was just being greedy
by hoping for an expensive graduation gift. To his father,
this small gift had more meaning than all the riches in the
world.
“Thank you, Dad,” he said sincerely. “It’s a great gift.
And you’re right. Maybe one day I will give it to my son or
daughter.” He had learned a great lesson.
The family had a wonderful dinner together. After the
meal, they sat around the table and the young man read
stories to the family. His mother said with a smile, “You
know, my favourite story is the last one in the book.
Please read that one.”
The young man flipped to the back of the book. Suddenly,
his face went blank. He was totally shocked. Taped to the
back cover was a car key!
It was the key to a used car -- not a new one -- but it didn’t
matter to the son. The lesson he learned that day made
him appreciate it even more.

Marco Polo
In13th century Europe, silk, tea, spices and gold were
what made people rich. And China was known to have
them in abundance.
But the only way to get those treasures was to travel
overland to China via the Silk Road. This was a dangerous
journey and one that was controlled by the Arabs through
Constantinople. Only friends and partners of the Arabs
were allowed to pass safely along the trail.
Europeans were not allowed to travel this road. This drove
up the costs of the precious goods.
The Polo family was one of the wealthiest merchant
families in Venice, a city state and major trading power at
the time. They took it upon themselves to seek out a route
to China that would avoid the Silk Road.
In 1266, they journeyed east from Venice and arrived at
Kaifeng, the eastern capital of the Mongol Emperor Kublai
Khan. They returned to Venice in 1269. Two years later,
they left again on a second voyage. This time, they took
the young Marco Polo with them.
They reached Cambuluc (now Beijing) in 1275. Marco
became a favourite of the great Kublai Khan and was
allowed to learn much about the Chinese way of life.
When he returned to his home in Venice after a long stay
in China, he wrote a book that described his life in China.
He called it The Travels ofMarco Polo. In the book, he
explained much about the customs and ways of the
people who lived there.
The Europeans were fascinated by his descriptions of the
Chinese culture and technology. He wrote about paper
currency, asbestos, coal, gunpowder, and other marvels
that were unknown in Europe at the time.
Marco Polo and his family established an overland trade
route to China, but it wasn’t until the first sea route was
discovered that travel and commerce between the East
and the West would become easy.

Bees -- Farmers’ Friends
I love insects, all kinds of insects. My favourite is the
honeybee. I love everything about this energetic little
creature. My respect for honeybees began when I was a
youngster, visiting my great uncle’s farm.
Great Uncle George kept animals, but he made most of
his living from his apple orchard. After breakfast one
spring morning, he invited me to help him work with the
bees that he kept in his orchard. The apple trees were in
full bloom.
“It’s very important that we take care of the bees,” he
explained. “Everyone who grows food needs their help.
Bees are pollinators -- they help move the pollen from one
flower to another. They make reproduction in the plant
world possible. Without pollination, there would be no
apples, no pears, no beans and no rice.”
He asked me if I understood how plants made new plants.
I told him that I didn’t. He explained that some plants are
males and some are females. They develop flowers, and
on certain parts of these flowers, they produce pollen -- a
tiny sticky substance. For a female plant to reproduce, it
needs some pollen from a male plant.
“Bees are the main source of pollination in the plant
world,” he continued. “The bees are attracted to flowers
because they’re after something inside the flower that they
use to make their food. Bees go right inside the flower and
use their uniquely designed mouths to collect a sweet
substance known as nectar. As they gather nectar, a
substance called pollen sticks to their bodies.
“When bees move on to the next flower, they are helping
plants to reproduce. Some of the pollen caught on their
legs and bodies falls off on the next plant they visit. If it’s a
female, the pollen will do its work and the female can
reproduce. It can make fruits and vegetables containing
seeds.”
My uncle’s explanation stuck with me for weeks. My
fascination with honeybees continued as I grew older.
Thank you, honeybees, for helping all the wonderful
flowers, fruits and grains to exist.

Tin Cans and Science
Billy and his friend Jane have been learning about sound
in their science class. So far, they learned that sound is a
vibration. Someone speaks, the sound travels to us and
we hear it. Sound vibrations travel through the air. They
also discovered that sound vibrations can travel on wires.
Their science teacher, Mr. Green, likes to explain the
theories behind science. He also thinks it’s important to
see science in action. Mr. Green suggested that they try a
simple sound experiment.
He told his two students that all they needed for their
scientific demonstration was some string (about 5 metres),
two tin cans and two paper clips. “Make sure there are no
sharp edges on the cans,” their teacher cautioned.
“First, you make a small hole in the bottom of each the tin
can. Then, take one end of the string and pass it through
the hole in one of the cans. Wrap that end around the
paper clip, and tie a big knot so that the string cannot slip
out through the hole. Do the same thing with the other
can.
“When everything is assembled, each of you takes a can
and walks away from each other until the string is very
tight. One of you puts the tin can up to your ear -- you are
the listener. The other speaks into his can. The listener
should easily be able to hear what the speaker is saying.”
Billy and Jane found the materials they needed and did
exactly as Mr. Green had explained. They put everything
together and then tried it out. First, Jane spoke into the
can. She said, “Billy, can you hear me?”
Her friend answered back right away. “That’s amazing,”
she said quietly. “I can really hear you clearly. I can almost
feel the sound vibrations coming down the string!”
The next day, Mr. Green asked them what they had
learned. “That’s easy,” said Jane. “Our voices are
vibrations. We speak into the can and it vibrates. The
vibrations can make the string vibrate too. When the
vibrations reach the can at the other end, they make the
can and the air vibrate. That’s why my friend could hear
me.”
Try it sometime. Science really is fun.

The Woman and Her Apple Tree
(adapted from a French folk tale)
Long ago, an old woman had a beautiful apple tree that
produced very sweet fruit. Everyone in the village wanted
to taste her apples, but no one asked for permission.
The old woman grew angry when villagers stole her
apples. She would gladly give them for free. But when
people did not ask, they were stealing.
One day, there was a knock at her door. A tired old man
asked if he might have a few apples, for he was hungry
and had no money. The old woman was surprised. This
was the first time that someone asked for permission. She
happily agreed.
The man picked four apples. “You are a kind woman,” he
said. “I have the power to grant you any wish. Ask, and I
shall give it to you as a sign of my thanks.”
The woman asked for that anyone, other than her, who
touched her tree would become stuck to it. “They must
stay there until I let them go,” she said. Her wish was
granted.
Before long, a man came to steal some apples. Upon
touching the tree, he became stuck and could not get free.
The old woman said she would let him go if he promised
never to steal apples again. Of course, he promised.
The old woman set him free, and he ran off to warn others
in the village about what had happened.
One night, Old Man Death came to the woman’s house. “It
is time for you to come with me,” he said. The old woman
was not ready to die. “It’s such a long trip. Let me get
some cheese,” she said. “And you go out and pick some
apples, so we can have good things to eat on our journey.”
Old Man Death was surprised. Most people were not so
kind when they met him. But when he touched the tree, he
became stuck and could not get free. He begged the
woman to help him. “Only if you do not take me until I am
ready to go,” she demanded. Since he had no other
choice, Old Man Death agreed.
To this day, the old woman is not ready to die. She lives
happily with her apple tree and its sweet red apples.

Playing Chess
My grandpa loves playing Chinese chess. When he was in
China, people came to play with him every day. When he
came to Canada for a visit, nobody would play chess with
him anymore.
One day after school, I found him dozing off in a chair.
He seemed lonely. I came up with an idea to help him. I
registered an account on the Internet that would allow my
grandfather to play chess online.
I woke him up and said, “Grandpa, someone is waiting to
play chess with you.” “What?” he said, his eyes opening
wide. “Who? Where?”
“Come here,” I said. I told him to sit down in front of the
computer. On the screen, there was a chessboard. “The
board is set up for you,” I explained. “You can play with
good players from around the world.”
He had difficulty controlling the mouse. He was too slow.
So I decided to be his hand. He told me where he wanted
to go, and I controlled the mouse. After a few tests, we
began to play a real game.
“Move the horse left,” I clicked. “Pawn forward.” I did what
he said. It was a tough game, as I chose to play with
someone with a high score. Each move was strategic.
When you play the game online, there is a clock that
counts the time after each move. Because my grandfather
and I were still getting used to coordinating, it took time to
move a piece. The other player moved another step
before we responded to his move. Grandpa got very
serious, “He moved two steps. He cheated!”
As I was trying to explain, the other player moved again.
Grandpa was very upset. He quit the game and said,
“I don’t want to play with someone who doesn’t follow the
rules!” Of course, we dropped the game halfway through.
And that was the end of our online game.
A month later, Grandpa was leaving for China. The family
prepared something special to welcome him home. A team
of chess players was waiting there to play with him.
As for me, I will always remember that time I played with
my grandpa online.

History of the Bicycle
Today’s bicycles are light, fast, and comfortable. As we
travel around on bicycles, we might not be aware of the
long history of this amazing little machine.
No one can say for sure when the bicycle was invented.
What we do know is that early scooter-like bikes were
invented in France in the late 1700s. These early bicycles
did not look much like bicycles at all. Sure, they had two
wheels, but that was all they had in common with the
modern bike.
They were propelled forward in much the same way that a
scooter is today. One leg ran along the ground, while the
other leg rested on a platform between the two wheels.
The rider ran beside the bike to build up speed, then
jumped on and coasted for a while.
This primitive bicycle enjoyed short-lived popularity as it
was not practical for transportation in any place other than
well-maintained roads.
By the middle of the 1800s, improvements were made to
the early bicycles. A treadmill for moving the bicycle
forward was added, allowing the rider to keep both feet on
the bicycle at all times. Since the bicycle was made of
wood, and later of metal tires, riding on the rough roads of
the day was extremely uncomfortable.
The next advancement was the addition of pedals to
provide more efficient propulsion. The pedals were
attached directly to the front wheel. You can imagine how
difficult this bicycle was to ride.
In the late 1870s, a huge front wheel was used and the
seat was moved forward so that the rider could sit directly
over the front wheel and pedals. However, riding these
bicycles was dangerous because the rider sat up high
over a huge front wheel. Imagine falling off one of those
bicycles!
In 1885, the first successful “safety” bicycle was designed.
It addressed safety issues by reducing the size of the front
wheel. The seat of this bike was positioned further back
towards the middle of the bike, and a basic gearing
system was added.
The new design also added the steering bars over the
front wheel and a drive chain to attach the pedals to the
rear wheel.
With this, the safety bicycle was born. The rest, as they
say, is history!

Meeting in the Middle
(adapted from a traditional Japanese legend)
There once lived a frog near the city of Kyoto. He
dreamed of making a voyage to the city of Osaka.
Everyone said it was the finest city in all the world.
Meanwhile, another frog, who lived in Osaka, was
dreaming of travelling to the great city of Kyoto.
Now, neither frog knew each other, nor did they know that
at exactly the same moment, they each set out to fulfill
their dreams.
For many days, the two frogs travelled in different
directions towards their goal. The trip was exhausting,
especially when they each came to a mountain exactly
halfway between the two cities. But neither gave up his
dream. Each, on his own, climbed all the way to the top of
the mountain. When they got to the top, they were very
tired. They both stopped to rest, falling asleep only a few
metres from each other.
When they awoke, they were surprised to see the other
there. And naturally, as travellers often do, they struck up
a conversation. The Kyoto frog explained that he was on
his way to see Osaka. And the Osaka frog said that it was
a strange thing, but he was on his way to explore the fine
city of Kyoto.
After a while, they decided to stand on their back legs,
leaning against each other so each could look at the city
to which he was travelling. There was only one problem.
As you know, when a frog stands up, his eyes are on the
back of his head. So, when they pointed their noses in the
direction of their destinations, they were actually looking
back at their own cities -- the ones from which they had
just come.
“Oh my!” exclaimed the Kyoto frog. “Your city looks exactly
like my city. There is no difference at all.” And the
Osaka frog, who was really looking back at his own city,
exclaimed, “What a disappointment. Your city looks
exactly like mine.”
The two frogs sadly decided not to travel further. Why go
all that way only to discover a city exactly like their own?
And for the rest of their lives, they mistakenly believed that
Osaka and Kyoto were exactly the same. And as you
know, nothing could be further from the truth.

The Car Ride
I get carsick. I can’t help it. The only way for me to travel in
a car is to ride in the front. That way, I can see out the
front window and I feel better.
One day, we were going to a soccer game. We gave some
other kids a ride. My father was driving our little family van.
After the game, it was time to go, so I took the soccer balls
and put them in the back of the van. Then, all of a sudden,
I felt a push from behind and my friends all loaded into the
back beside me. I was trapped in the back seat!
When my dad got in the van, I could see that he looked
worried. I was embarrassed that he might mention my
problem, so I cut him off as he was about to speak. I said,
“Let’s go! We’re all good back here.” And we started out.
Maybe it was because it was so hot and crowded, soon
I began to feel very sick. I reached for the window,
forgetting that the rear windows don’t go down. Oh no! I
really was in trouble.
I could see my dad looking in the rear-view mirror, and he
could see I was turning green. Suddenly, he pulled into a
parking lot in front of a store and stopped the car. “Okay,”
he said, “everyone gets out for an ice cream cone.”
Everyone got out of the car. First John, and then Yuan,
Will, Mohamed and Ben. It seemed to take forever. Finally,
I slid off the seat and got out for some fresh air!
I barely made it out of the car. But I recovered quickly.
And before I knew it, we were driving down the street with
me in the front seat this time. Everyone was enjoying their
ice cream.
My dad winked at me as we drove down the street. I
smiled back. Sometimes dads can be so smart.

A Movie Night
It was late afternoon when Tony picked up Alisha from
school. They were going to see a movie. Almost
immediately after they began to drive away, the sky turned
grey and it began to rain. Soon, the rain was falling hard
and fast.
Tony turned his wipers on at full-speed and drove along
cautiously. Most of the drivers on the road slowed down
too and turned on their lights so the other drivers would
see them better.
As Tony turned off the main road, a bright blue sports car
passed them in a hurry. Suddenly, the car swerved and
crashed into the ditch beside the road.
Tony carefully pulled his car over to the shoulder and got
out. Alisha quickly unbuckled her seatbelt, zipped up her
coat, and followed him.
“Are you okay?” Tony asked when he saw a man emerge
from the driver’s side. The pouring rain made it hard for
him to hear the man’s response.
They walked closer to the car. “I’m okay,” the man said
shakily. “Are you hurt?” Tony asked. The man shook his
head. “No, not really,” he said. “My car is damaged. Do
you have a cellphone?” Tony pulled out his cellphone from
his jacket and passed it to him.
The young man called a tow truck company to explain the
situation. Then he thanked Tony and Alisha for helping.
“Why were you in such a rush?” Tony asked. The young
man looked sheepish. “I was trying to get to the movie
theatre. I didn’t want to be late.” Tony smiled. “We were
going to the movies too,” he said.
Alisha looked at her watch. “The movie is scheduled to
start in ten minutes. It doesn’t look like we’re going to see
it tonight.”
“Please, go then,” the young man said. “I don’t want to
ruin your evening.”
Tony shook his head. “Never mind. We can go to see that
movie another day,” he said. “And you can come with us,”
Alisha added.

Turning Garbage Into New Earth
My father is a quiet and reserved man. He has his
opinions, but he usually keeps them to himself. Don’t get
me wrong. If you ask him for advice, he is always willing to
share his wisdom with you. But, he goes about his
business without too much fuss.
There is one thing though that really gets him excited. Just
mention the word “garbage” to him! He is passionate
about garbage. Or should I say, he is passionate about
solving the garbage problem!
Dad believes that time is running out as far as garbage
goes. “We have become a ‘throw-away’ society,” he says.
“We buy and buy, and then we throw it away. We can’t
keep doing this. Garbage is everybody’s problem.”
My father doesn’t just talk about it though. When he sees
a problem, he tries to find a solution.
Last year, my father decided to do something about all the
wasted food we were throwing away. An average family
produces nearly 500 pounds of food waste each year.
We peel our potatoes and throw away the skins. We eat
an apple and throw away the core. Imagine how that piles
up in our landfill sites!
Don’t worry, though. There is something that we can do
about it. Food waste is known as “organic matter”. If
properly handled, it can be changed from garbage to a
rich, dark earth known as compost. This compost can be
added to vegetable gardens to make the plants grow
really well.
“We are going to start composting our food waste,”
Dad announced one night at dinner. “I purchased a
compost bin today. From now on, instead of throwing all
our food waste in the garbage, we will put it in the
compost bin. Mother Nature will slowly turn it from
garbage into earth. In a few months, we will have rich and
beautiful compost material to add to our garden.”
It took a while to get used to it, but soon, we were taking
our food waste to the compost bin in the backyard. In
three months, we opened the lid. We found it full of
nutrient-rich new earth!

Whispering Trees
(adapted from a European folk tale)
Long ago, humans lived in a beautiful garden. They lived
happily and did not need to work. They made mistakes,
however, and displeased their creator. Soon they were
driven from the garden. For the first time, people had to
work. Life was difficult for everyone.
Woodcutters were especially troubled, for in those days,
humans were not alone in their ability to speak. Plants and
trees could talk too. Of course, when the woodcutter came
to the forest, the trees were not happy.
When his axe first struck a pine tree, the tree cried out
loudly, “Do not cut me, please! Can you not see the tears
running down my trunk with each cut of your sharp axe?”
Indeed, the woodcutter saw the thick, sticky sap coming
out from the pine. He moved along, coming next to a
spruce tree. As his axe struck the spruce, the tree
shouted, “Do not cut me, Sir! Can you not see that my
wood is twisted and soft? It is of no value to you! Please,
leave me alone!”
Then, the woodcutter came to an alder tree. When his axe
struck the alder, a red sap began to flow from the tree.
“Ouch!” cried the alder. “Do not cut me. Can you not see
that my blood runs red when you cut me? My wood is of
no use to you!”
The woodcutter returned to the garden and explained his
situation to the creator. “Humans must now work as you
commanded,” he said. “But I cannot do my job because
the trees cry when my axe strikes them. They make
excuses and keep me from my work.”
The creator promised to make things better. He forbade
the trees to argue with the woodcutter. Being too
frightened to go against the word of their creator, the trees
no longer shouted when the axe struck them.
But they were still upset. Afraid to shout, they whispered in
low voices that did not distract the woodcutter while he
worked.
And that is why today you can hear the trees whispering
quietly in the woods when humans enter. They still
complain, but they do so quietly so as not to disobey their
creator.

What Will I Be?
What will I be when I grow up? It’s a big question. People
have asked me this question many times. And I don’t
really know the answer yet.
Maybe I’ll be a doctor. Medicine is a great career -- an
honoured profession in all cultures. A doctor’s job is about
helping people. And helping others is just about the most
important thing in the world.
There is just one small problem: I have a rather weak
stomach. I don’t like the sight of blood and I don’t like
needles. The idea of setting a broken bone back into its
proper place makes me feel a little sick too.
For thousands of years, doctors have been saving lives.
I wonder who the first doctors were. Were they people
who noticed things about others and tried to help them?
Kings and rulers have had their own doctors for thousands
of years. When the doctor wasn’t able to cure the king’s
problem, the doctor’s life was in danger. So being a doctor
was never easy.
Before modern medicine was invented, there were a lot of
diseases that could not be cured at all. The only thing a
doctor could do was to tell the person the bad news.
Something that I like about medicine is that it is practised
differently around the world. In some cultures, they only
have natural medicines that come from plants, trees and
other living things. I guess people have their own way of
practising medicine.
Sometimes, I wonder if the drugs that humans make for
diseases and illnesses are really any better than those
found in nature. Maybe the cures for all diseases are
sitting in the plants and trees around us and we just need
to find the right one.
Now that I think about it, being around sick people all day
would probably make me feel sad and depressed. I am
beginning to realize that maybe being a doctor isn’t really
a good idea for me.
Maybe I’ll be an engineer. It’s still a good way to help
people, right?

Mom Lost Her Keys
My mom lost her keys -- a set of keys that gives her
access to every place in her life. It might not seem like a
big deal. But without these keys, her life became really
inconvenient.
She couldn’t go to the office easily. She had to report to
the security guard every time. She couldn’t go home easily
either. She had to wait until someone else arrived home.
I learned from Mom and Dad what happened the day
before. It was a warm day in late fall. It was the kind of day
people call an “Indian summer”.
The day was too nice to stay inside. Mom asked Dad to
take a walk along the Ottawa River. She brought her
camera and they walked six or seven kilometres. They
saw seagulls, ducks and all kinds of other birds. They saw
ripe blackberries hanging on the leafless tree branches.
Mom took pictures as they strolled along. Obviously, they
enjoyed the afternoon very much. But the next morning,
Mom couldn’t find her keys.
Mom and Dad went back to the river. They searched
everywhere with their heads bent low, looking in all the
places they passed the day before. They even used their
pictures to help them locate the places where they had
stopped.
After spending half the day searching, they didn’t find any
keys. But they did find something unexpected. Mom found
some coins on the riverbank, and she felt it proved that
her keys likely slipped out of her pocket. While checking
the car, Dad found a USB flash drive that Mom had lost a
long time ago. When Mom posted an ad on a local Lost
and Found website, she found she wasn’t the only one
who had lost keys.
In the end, Mom didn’t get her keys back. But as she said,
she discovered some new lost treasures and enjoyed a
wonderful afternoon walk with Dad. Also, she found out
something worth telling me -- she wants to live in a society
where no locks are needed.

Paper
Would you be surprised to learn that the book you’re
reading was once a tree? To be more accurate, the paper
in the book was once a tree. That’s right, the story of
paper begins somewhere in a forest.
Trees are wood, which is made up of millions of tiny fibres.
Paper is made by separating these fibres. But wait, we’re
getting ahead of ourselves. Let’s go back to the forest,
where it all starts.
Trees grow in forests or on planted farms. When they
reach a certain size, they are cut down by tree cutters.
They are then transported to a factory known as a pulp
mill. This is where turning trees into paper really begins.
First, the wood logs are chopped into small pieces called
chips. The chips are then put into a liquid (mostly water)
and are turned into a thick mush. This process is called
pulping. The end product is called pulp. You can see why
the place where all this takes place is called a pulp mill.
The next step is the most important. The pulp must be
dried. At first, it is nearly all water, but a two-step process
dries it out completely.
First, the pulp is sprayed onto screens and the water
begins to drip away. Large rollers are then rolled over the
pulp, squeezing more water out of it. At this point, the pulp
begins to look more like paper as the fibres begin to join
and bond.
The last stage is the final drying. This takes place in a hot
drum filled with steam. The partially dried pulp enters the
drying machine in wide sheets. It still has a lot of water in
it. Hot rollers squeeze out the water as they roll over it.
Slowly, the pulp is dried and flattened. It is now paper. It is
put on large rolls and shipped all over the world.
It takes a lot of trees to make paper. That’s why recycling
is a really good idea.
Paper can be recycled easily because it’s made of fibres.
All you have to do is take old paper, turn it back into pulp,
and dry it out again. You can save a tree and help the
environment at the same time.

Smiling Renaldo
Renaldo wasn’t very cool. He was the new kid. He came
from another country, and he didn’t speak English very
well. In fact, he barely spoke at all. When he did, you
could barely hear him. No one had ever seen him smile --
not once.
Weeks of the new school year passed, and he barely said
a word. Even our teacher, Ms. Sole, couldn’t make him
smile. Finally, we decided that we would have a contest.
The goal was to see who could make Renaldo smile.
The next day at school, we tried everything. We tried
jokes. We tried falling down in front of him. We tried
making funny faces. Nothing worked. We gave up and
went to class.
In English class that day, we had a new teacher. He was
handsome and young, and all of us liked him. The first
thing he did was to ask everyone to introduce themselves.
Up and down the rows he went. Everyone said their
names. When it was Renaldo’s turn, he said his name
very softly, so the teacher asked him to repeat it. He could
see that Renaldo was shy. He knelt down to be closer to
him. Renaldo was at the back of the class, so everyone
had turned around to see him.
“Please repeat your name,” the teacher said, smiling at
Renaldo. Then, Renaldo did the most amazing thing. He
noticed something about the teacher. And he gave a huge
smile and said, “My name is Renaldo!” The whole class
cheered.
I bet you’re wondering why he smiled. All this time,
Renaldo had been embarrassed to smile until he realized
he had something in common with the handsome new
teacher -- braces! You know? Those weird wire things
dentists put on kids’ teeth to make them straight.
From that day on, Renaldo smiled all the time. You could
tell he felt it was really cool to have braces.

The Masked Bandit
One day, our class went on a field trip to a mountain about
five hours away from our school.
It’s not a very steep mountain, so we were able to walk up.
But it was still hard work. We carried a lot of supplies on
our backs: tents, food, dishes, tools, clothes and many
other things. Each pack weighed 10 to15 kilograms. We
were going to camp at the top of the mountain.
When we arrived at the top of the mountain, we pitched
our tents and got ready to spend a night there.
We were told to hang all our food in the trees. Why? The
reason was simple. If we didn’t, the bears would come for
it… and we didn’t want that!
So that night, we had a big meal around the fire. Then, we
put our food in a bag and hung it from a tree branch.
When we woke up in the morning, we got out of our tents
to make breakfast. But to our surprise, the bag with the
food was gone!
We thought a bear must have taken it, but the branch was
not nearly strong enough to hold a large, one-thousand
pound bear.
We were very hungry, but we had no food! We started
down the mountain. And then we saw it -- our bag of food
was on the ground. We ran over to it and it moved. Inside
the food bag was a large raccoon. She must have climbed
up the branch, chewed through the rope and made off with
the bag.
The raccoon looked at us and made a frightening sound
like a cat. Then, three baby raccoons came out of the bag,
and they all walked away.
We had been so worried about bears that we forgot about
the other creatures. Our teacher said, “Raccoons will steal
anything. I guess that’s why they wear masks over their
eyes!”
We all laughed. But it was a long, hungry trip home!

Voices From the Past
Have you ever wondered how we learn about the past?
Especially about things that took place on Earth millions of
years ago? For example, how do we know about
dinosaurs or any of the thousands of other creatures that
were on this planet before humans showed up?
The answer to this question is one word: fossils.
Fossils are the hardened remains of plants and animals
that roamed the earth in the distant past. The word fossil
comes from Latin and means “dug up”, which is how
fossils are found.
Sometimes, a fossil is simply a footprint left behind by an
animal as it walked on Earth in the prehistoric era.
Sometimes, it’s the creature’s entire body. And sometimes,
it’s just a single bone or tooth. But always, it’s a sign from
long ago -- evidence of what life was like in prehistoric
times.
Perhaps you’ve seen pictures of fossils or viewed them in
a museum. The earliest fossils date back more than four
billion years. Fossils have the same shape and size as the
original animal or plant.
As a result of major disasters such as sudden changes in
the environment, plants and animals died without warning.
One moment, they were going about their lives, eating and
breathing. And the next, they were covered with sand,
water or ice.
Over a period of thousands of years, some of these
creatures slowly fossilized or turned to stone. Thousands
of these fossils lay undiscovered in every corner of the
earth. Only a few had been unearthed until the early
1800s, when a young English girl and her father spotted
something strange in the sand as they walked along the
seashore at low tide.
At first, they had no idea what they had found. They
decided to dig it out of the sand and take it home. News of
their discovery soon spread and scientists began to visit
them to examine the strange objects they were finding
buried along the English coast near their village.
Like voices from the past, these newly discovered relics
began to unlock the mystery of what life was like in
prehistoric times.

The Polanski Run
There is an old man in our neighbourhood who is very
unusual. The fact that he jogs every day is not unusual,
but what he does while jogging is. What does he do that is
so out of the ordinary? He picks up garbage.
The first time I saw him running along, I could see that he
had something in his hands. I thought maybe it was a pair
of gloves. But then, he slowed down, bent over and picked
up a piece of paper that was lying there. It was then that I
realized he had all kinds of things in his hands.
This strange old man became famous in our
neighbourhood. He never talked to anyone, but whenever
he went by, I would smile and wave. He was always
stopping to pick up garbage that some thoughtless person
had thrown right on the street.
One day, we heard the news that while jogging, the
strange old man was hit by a car and would have to spend
some time in the hospital. We also learned that he could
not speak English very well, which was why he didn’t talk
to anyone.
One of our teachers heard the news and decided to do
something. She contacted the local television news
channel and told them his story.
The reporter went with a translator to visit the old man and
write a story about him. His name was Mr. Polanski.
In the country where Mr. Polanski grew up, there was no
garbage on the street. So when he first saw people drop
papers, cans, packages, and anything else they didn’t
want, it really upset him. He wanted to help clean up the
garbage so he could be happy in this new country.
Later, our school decided that we would have a run in the
spring to pick up garbage, just like Mr. Polanski. He was
even invited to cut the ribbon for the first run.
We called it the “Polanski Run”. That day, hundreds of kids
jogged around the neighbourhood in groups, picking up
garbage and putting it in bags. It became one of our
school’s annual events.

The Prince and the Lion
(from a traditional European tale)
There was a young prince who had a pet lion. The lion
was his friend, but unfortunately, the lion was never let out
of his cage. This made the lion feel sad because he
thought that if he was considered a friend, then why was
he not allowed out of the cage?
Next to the lion’s cage was a hyena. He hated the lion.
One day, the hyena said to the lion, “If you are the friend
of this prince, why does he keep you in a cage?”
The prince was about to answer, when the hyena cut him
off and said, “The reason, Lion, is because of your big
teeth.” The prince laughed at this and said, “No, it’s not
because of his teeth!”
“Then it’s because of your claws. They could kill the prince
with one swipe!” the hyena said to the lion. The prince
laughed again, “No, it’s not because of his claws. I trust
the lion will not hurt me. The reason he’s in the cage is
because I’m afraid that if I were to let him out, he’d see
how wonderful it is to be free, and he would leave me. I
couldn’t stand that.”
The hyena said, “Oh, but you’re wrong, young prince!
We love our cages. We’d never leave. Open my cage and
I’ll show you.” The innocent young prince opened the cage
and the hyena immediately jumped on the prince to eat
him.
Suddenly, the lion jumped out of his cage and grabbed the
hyena in his powerful claws. The hyena escaped and ran
off, never to be seen again.
The young prince was surprised and asked, “Lion, how did
you get out?” The lion replied, “My prince, my cage was
never locked. I have always stayed here because we are
friends.”
From that day on, the cage door was taken off. The prince
learned a valuable lesson that day. He learned that a
friendship without trust is not a friendship at all.

A Flying Whale?
Have you ever sat outside on a dark evening and looked
up at the stars? They appear very close, but actually they
are very far away.
Imagine living 10,000 years ago as cavemen did. Imagine
seeing a shooting star, a meteorite, or an eclipse of the
sun! These things must have frightened people a long time
ago.
It’s good that science has explained what these things
mean. We don’t have to be scared anymore. But it’s
important to realize that there is still a lot that we don’t
understand about the universe.
We know today that some stars are so far away that you
could not reach them even in a billion years. And some of
those lights in the sky are quite close -- only 60 or 70
million kilometres away. Compared with the size of the
universe, this distance is like the distance between you
and your nextdoor neighbour!
For us, the most important star is called Sol. As our sun, it
is the centre of life. If we were a little closer to it or a little
farther away, life would never have been able to start on
this planet we call Earth.
Imagine if there is life on other planets, how different that
life might be -- especially when you consider the amazing
differences in the creatures here on Earth. It’s hard to
imagine that on one small planet like ours, creatures can
be as different as ants and whales. And that’s just on the
planet WE live on!
Imagine what kind of life forms there may be on other
planets. How about a flying whale or cats that are as
smart as humans?
Flying whales? Maybe or maybe not. But one thing is
certain -- travelling on a flying whale would be a lot more
fun than travelling on an airplane. Don’t you agree?

Thorns of the Rose
A grandmother and grandfather were trying to comfort
their granddaughter who had just grabbed the stem of a
rose and cut herself on a thorn. Through her tears, she
asked her grandfather, “How can something so pretty
have thorns?”
The grandfather thought for a moment, and then he began
to tell her a story.
“Many years ago, there was a young man who saw a
beautiful woman. He wanted to marry her. But she was
difficult to talk to and hard to get to know. She didn’t talk to
people very much. Everyone who approached her turned
away in disappointment. She refused to let them get close.
Some people said the girl was like a rose with a thorn.”
“She was like that rose?” asked the child. “Yes, she was.
But not in the way you think,” the grandfather said.
“She had a difficult childhood. She lived with her father
and stepmother. She always tried to be perfect to please
her parents. If anything went wrong, it was always her that
was blamed. Her stepmother said the girl’s beauty was a
curse.”
“As the girl grew older, she kept people away to protect
herself. In a way, she was like the rose, which has thorns
so that it can protect itself.”
The child said, “I see. What happened to them?”
The grandmother took over the story then. “The young
man wrote the girl beautiful letters every day, and he
delivered his letters with flowers,” she said. “In each of
these letters, he wrote a beautiful story that brought great
joy to the girl. Gradually, she learned to trust people. Soon
after that, they got married. Now she loves to have people
around her, and she especially loves her granddaughter.”
The grandmother then hugged the little girl.
Shocked, the child asked, “You mean you were that girl,
Grandma?”
The grandmother took the child’s hand, put it against her
soft, wrinkled face and said, “Yes, that was me. But as you
can feel, there are no thorns left.”

Tower of Confusion
(adapted from a Bible story)
Have you ever wondered why there are so many different
languages all over the world? Long ago, humans spoke
only one language. Everyone understood everyone else.
And their creator was happy.
Humans obeyed their creator and began to travel all over
the earth as they were commanded to do. But one man
was rebellious. His name was Nimrod. Nimrod wanted to
be a leader. He told the people that they did not have to
spread out over the earth. “Come settle with me here,” he
said. “Let us build a city and do as we desire.”
The people followed and Nimrod became their leader. He
instructed them to settle in his city where he could control
and rule over them. One day, he commanded them to
build a tall tower. “Let us make a building that reaches to
the heavens,” he said. And the people obeyed. The
bricklayers, the carpenters and the builders began to
construct a tower that would reach the sky.
The creator watched them and was not pleased. He
wanted his people to go to all corners of the earth so that
humans would live everywhere. He could not tolerate the
disobedience of his people. He wanted to make them stop
building.
Being wise and all-knowing, the creator made it so that
everyone began to speak a different language. The
bricklayers could not understand each other, and the
carpenters could not understand the bricklayers. There
was great confusion in the city.
The building of the tower came to a stop immediately.
Why? It’s simple really: how could they work together
when they could not understand each other? Soon, the
city became known as Babel, which means “confusion”.
The wisest people turned back to their creator. They
followed his instructions and left Babel. They moved
across the earth, so that humans were everywhere again.
But still, each group now spoke its own language.

Flat Tire
My dad was in a panic! We were driving to the store to get
some last-minute things for a big dinner we were having
for my dad’s company and a new customer he was hoping
to impress.
As we drove, we noticed an older man at the side of the
road. He had a flat tire. Normally, my dad would stop, but
this time he said, “We’re too busy right now!”
About half an hour later, when we were heading back
home with our groceries, we saw the old man still there
working on the tire.
This time, my dad could not resist. He pulled the car over
and got out. “Having some trouble, are you?” he asked.
“Yes,” said the older man. “I can’t get the wheel off.
You are the only person who has stopped to offer
assistance.”
My dad signalled to me, and I jumped out.
In no time, we had the old wheel off and the new one on.
The older man saw that we were pretty messy, and he
offered to pay us. Of course, my dad said no.
We made our way home. And at precisely 6 p.m., my
dad’s boss and two of his colleagues showed up. The
boss was very nervous for he had only met the customer
once, and my dad had not met him at all.
Then the doorbell rang, and my father answered the door.
My father’s face went white. It was the older man with the
flat tire by the side of the road!
The old man could not believe his eyes. He grabbed my
father’s hand and said, “As far as I’m concerned, the deal
is done! You’re a man with a sense of honour and
responsibility. You have taught your son well. Your
company has my business. Now let’s eat!”
Of course, my dad didn’t help a stranger to be rewarded.
But it often happens that when we do the right thing, the
right thing happens to us.
