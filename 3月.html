    A Bird’s Nest!
    As a young boy, I eagerly listened to my father telling his
    childhood stories. The image of him and his friends
    climbing to the top of a tree to fetch a bird’s nest hung in
    my mind for quite a while. I dreamed of peeking into a
    bird’s nest that had eggs or small baby birds inside, like
    my father did when he was a boy.
    But that was almost impossible.
    First, youngsters today are not allowed to climb trees.
    People think it’s too dangerous. Second, we don’t have so
    many birds’ nests around anymore. The healthy eco-
    system of Dad’s youth day is slowly disappearing. The
    number of bird and animal species declines every year,
    and some even disappear forever.
    However, early one spring day, my dream came true.
    It was a Saturday morning. My dad’s best friend, who I call
    Uncle Ben, invited us to visit his business. He sold used
    cars at his shop outside the city.
    It was a large lot, which had about one hundred cars
    parked on it. Surrounding it were a lot of trees.
    Uncle Ben led us through the parking lot, pointing out all
    kinds of different cars -- different makes, models, years
    and prices. As we walked across the lot, we suddenly
    found something unusual -- a bird’s nest on top of the rear
    wheel of a big truck!
    I was thrilled to be so close. I stared at the nest in
    amazement. It was real -- a real bird’s nest with a clutch of
    eggs sitting inside. “One, two, three, four.” Four little
    bluishgreen eggs!
    The nest was made of fine tree branches. It looked sturdy
    and warm. It was beautiful! How smart the little bird was to
    make such a delicate nest. And how creative it was to
    build the nest on the wheel for shelter in this cold
    Canadian weather!
    Uncle Ben took a look at the eggs. He said it was a
    Robin’s nest. To prevent the nest from being destroyed, he
    suggested that we move it to a tree beside the parking lot.
    We all sincerely hope that the Robin finds her new home
    and her baby birds.

    The Rower
    Mr. Hope, the janitor at our school, walks with a limp.
    Sometimes people make fun of his limp. It always makes
    me angry to hear them laughing at him.
    Watching him make his way slowly around our school with
    his broom and cleaning supplies in hand, I often wondered
    why he limped.
    One day as I was standing in the hall, I saw two boys
    laughing at Mr. Hope’s limp. The principal saw this and
    was very mad. I tried to explain that I didn’t know these
    boys, but the principal took all of us down to the
    basement. He showed us a picture of a young man
    standing by a long, thin boat. “This is Mr. Hope when he
    was a young man,” said the principal.
    I was shocked to learn that our janitor was once a great
    rower. In the 1968 Olympics, Mr. Hope had advanced to
    the final round. His only real competition was one other
    racer. The race started. These two boats were soon far
    ahead of the other boats, racing neck and neck towards
    the finish line.
    The race was going well when suddenly, Mr. Hope heard a
    huge cracking sound. He glanced over at his opponent
    and saw that his boat was sinking fast. The man was in
    trouble because the boat had broken right in the middle.
    He was stuck inside, unable to escape.
    The other boats were a long way back. Mr. Hope was the
    only one who could do anything. Without stopping to think,
    he dove into the water and pulled the man up from
    underneath the water.
    The other boats passed them on their way to the finish
    line, leaving the two men alone in the water. The other
    man had a broken leg and Mr. Hope’s leg was badly cut by
    the sharp wood splinters.
    Mr. Hope never finished the race. He never got a gold
    medal at the Olympics. He did end up getting a special
    medal for sportsmanship. His leg was never the same
    after his injury, and he has always limped since then.
    As they stood there listening, all the boys felt ashamed of
    what they had done. We all realized that Mr. Hope was a
    hero. His bravery and selfless actions made him an
    Olympic champion forever.

    Two Peas in a Pod
    Patrick and Grant have been best friends since the first
    day of primary school. They have been inseparable ever
    since. Patrick’s mother says that they are like “two peas in
    a pod”. She tells them, “A best friend is worth his weight in
    gold.”
    But one day, the two best friends stopped talking to each
    other.
    It didn’t take long for the parents to find out that the two
    boys had a serious argument. As they were walking home
    from school the other day, they talked about their
    homework. Grant wanted his pal to do it for both of them.
    He wanted to spend more time playing basketball – one of
    his favourite sports.
    “No way! I don’t think I can help you like this,” said Patrick.
    “We must know what our priorities are.”
    “Priorities?” asked Grant. “That’s just your excuse for
    refusing to help me. What a friend!” he said angrily. Patrick
    was hurt by his friend’s comments. He said, “You can say
    whatever you want, but I don’t think I’m helping you by
    lending you my assignment.”
    That afternoon, they parted and went their separate ways.
    In the days that followed, both of them felt bad.
    When Patrick’s parents realized what had happened, they
    asked him to think how to help his best friend. Meanwhile,
    Grant knew that it was his fault for starting this argument.
    A few days later, there was a school basketball game.
    Patrick went to the basketball court to watch.
    At the end of the game, the two old friends’ eyes met.
    Grant immediately came over and held out his hand. He
    tried to say something, but the words were stuck in his
    throat. Patrick smiled and said, “Good friends don’t have
    to say they are sorry. Their friends just know it.”
    That day, the two boys made a deal. They would work on
    the assignment first and play basketball after.

    A Birthday Wish
    There wasn’t much food in the house, but somehow the
    mother managed to find enough to make a cake.
    Her three children spent the afternoon cutting pictures
    from a magazine and making a wonderful birthday card for
    their father. They loved him very much. He worked hard in
    the woods every day and always came home cheerful and
    smiling.
    Most children simply went to the store and bought a
    birthday card for their fathers. This family had barely
    enough food in the cupboards. So they made a card and
    wrote a lovely little message to their father. It said:
    Happy Birthday to the best father in the world.
    You work hard and always think of us.
    We love you, we love you, we love you.
    YOU ARE THE BEST!
    When everything was ready, they sat down quietly and
    waited for their father to get home. Soon, they heard him
    coming. As he came in, they all jumped up and began to
    sing Happy Birthday. The father was surprised.
    “Please, let’s light the candles now,” said one of the boys.
    He was anxious to see if his father’s wish would be
    granted.
    The mother lit the candles and the father closed his eyes
    tightly. His children watched, imagining what his wish
    might be. Then, he drew in a big breath and blew out all of
    the candles on the cake. The children clapped. They
    asked him what he wished for. “Surely it will come true
    now that you have blown out all of the birthday candles!”
    The father looked around at his family. He saw his wife
    and knew how hard she had worked to find enough for the
    cake. The homemade birthday card from his children was
    better than any from the store. He knew that he was very
    lucky to have a family like this.
    “I wished that every father in the world could have a family
    as wonderful as mine,” he said. “Now let’s dig into this
    birthday cake. It sure looks good!”

    Your Lucky Day!
    There are many age-old beliefs about good luck and bad
    luck. Every culture has them. If something happens, then
    something else will happen.
    A black cat crosses the road in front of you. You spill salt
    at the dinner table. You walk under a ladder. You break a
    mirror. According to superstition, if any of these things
    happen, you are going to have bad luck.
    Walking down the street, you find a penny. Looking up into
    the sky on a star-filled night, you see a shooting star. In
    the grass, you find a clover with four leaves. If any of
    these things happen to you, it’s going to be a great day.
    You are going to have good luck.
    No one knows where superstitions about luck started.
    They were with us long before the scientific age. And they
    are still with us today, although most of us do not believe
    in them. Still, they hang on.
    Each generation teaches the youngsters the superstition
    of their culture. And because we learn them when we are
    young, we never forget them. We might not believe in
    them anymore, but we still feel a bit of fear and surprise
    when a black cat crosses our path.
    After all, who wants to have a bad day? If we break a
    mirror, we clean it up. However, there is a small part of us
    that asks, “Am I really going to have seven years bad luck
    just because I broke this mirror?”
    Most people remember seeing their first shooting star
    blazing across the night sky. Adults tell them, “Quickly,
    make a wish. It’s bound to come true.” And most children
    close their eyes and make that wish, believing that it will
    come true.
    Luck is luck. You can’t predict when you will have any
    good luck or bad luck. Still, it’s fun learning about
    superstitions. They have always been with us. They will
    probably still be with us for a long time to come.

    Getting the Coconuts Home
    (adapted from a traditional Filipino story)
    Sometimes when people speak, their words become a
    riddle, and are not easily understood.
    A man who made his living gathering coconuts in the
    countryside learned this lesson when he stopped to ask a
    young boy how long it would take him to get home. He
    had been working late gathering coconuts and piling them
    high on his wagon.
    Towards the end of the day, his wagon was filled to the
    brim with coconuts. He decided to head home, for it was
    getting late. He wished to know how long it would take to
    get back to his village so that he could arrive before
    darkness fell.
    He noticed a small boy along the roadside and stopped to
    ask for directions.
    “Young boy,” he said, “I am late and I must get home soon.
    How long will it take to get to my village from here?”
    The boy answered, “If you go slowly, it will take only a
    short while for you to get home. But if you go quickly, it will
    take a long time and you will not get there until late in the
    night.”
    The coconut gatherer thought about this answer, but he
    could not understand it. He gave the boy an angry look
    and hit his horse with the whip. The horse began to run
    quickly. But soon, coconuts began to fall from the wagon.
    Each time, the man got off to gather the fallen coconuts
    and put them back into his wagon.
    The faster he went, the more coconuts fell from his
    wagon, and the more time he had to take stopping to pick
    them up. But, if he had travelled slowly, none of the
    coconuts would have fallen, and the man would have
    arrived home much earlier.
    And so, as the young boy warned, go slowly and it will
    take only a short while

    Mosquito
    Buzz. Buzz. Buzz! On warm summer nights, the air is filled
    with the familiar sound of mosquitoes looking for a meal.
    These tiny insects are found everywhere, except in the
    coldest regions of the world. Most of us don’t like them.
    They can ruin a quiet evening. If there are enough of
    them, their biting can force us inside for protection.
    The bite doesn’t really hurt that much. Our skin swells
    where we are bitten. It gets itchy and can turn red, but in a
    few hours, the itching goes away.
    Did you know that only female mosquitoes bite?
    A female mosquito needs some protein in her diet to make
    eggs and have babies. She gets this protein from the
    blood of mammals. She is not too fussy about which
    mammals she bites. Any mammal will do, including
    humans.
    The female mosquito’s mouth has a long sharp point used
    to puncture the skin. The female then draws up some
    blood as if she were drinking with a straw.
    Mosquitoes have excellent smelling abilities and use their
    noses to find us. Humans are mammals, and that means
    we give off carbon dioxide when we breathe out. When a
    female picks up this scent, she moves in for her meal.
    Some of us are more attractive to the females than others.
    Scientists don’t exactly know why. Some suggest that the
    colour of our clothing or our blood type make some of us
    easier targets.
    We might hate these bothersome little bugs, but like all
    things in an eco-system, they have a purpose. Many
    animals, such as bats and birds, make mosquitoes a big
    part of their diet.
    For sure, mosquitoes are not fun when all we want to do is
    sit outside and enjoy a quiet summer evening. But there
    are things we can do to protect ourselves: wear a long-
    sleeved shirt or put on good insecticide can help keep
    these bugs away.

    Remembering the Future
    What would you want to tell kids from the future if you had
    the chance? That’s the situation my classmates and I
    faced today. You see, our school is old. It will be torn down
    at the end of this year. Next fall, we will move into a brand
    new school.
    Our teacher told us that we could put a “time capsule”
    together. What’s a time capsule? It’s a box in which you
    put things you think will be of interest to people in the
    future. When the workers start to build our new school,
    they will bury our time capsule inside the stone wall. In a
    hundred years, someone will find it.
    So, what to put in it? That was the question we talked
    about today. Someone suggested that we put in a CD with
    popular music of the day. That’s a good idea. That way,
    the future generation will know what kids like us enjoyed
    listening to. Someone else suggested leaving a copy of
    the day’s newspaper. I agree with that too. Why? It will
    show what was going on in our world on the day we filled
    our time capsule. There were many other good
    suggestions. A favourite book. Pictures of our old school.
    Pictures of us.
    I suggested that we all write a short letter. In the letter, we
    would describe what we think the future will be like --
    using our imagination! Everyone agreed with me. They
    thought it was a great idea. Imagine what kids in the future
    will think of us! They will be able to judge if what we said is
    right or wrong.
    Everyone was excited. It made us think about life in the
    future. It made us wonder what kids will be like in one
    hundred years.
    I can just imagine those kids in the future reaching into our
    time capsule. It makes me happy to think about that.
    What would you put in a time capsule if you were making
    one?

    The Gift of Growing
    My grandmother was a great old lady. When I was a 10-
    year-old boy, she came to stay with us in our village home.
    For an old lady living alone, the time had come for her to
    move off the farm.
    For the first few months, Grandmother seemed lonely and
    out of place. She wasn’t used to the traffic noises and
    missed the peace and quiet of life in the country. However,
    she slowly accepted that she would spend the rest of her
    life with us in a little village far from her childhood farm.
    When the warm spring winds began to blow, Grandma
    announced that she was going to plant a small garden. “I
    know,” she said when my father pointed out that we had
    no need to grow food. “We can buy all the food we need,
    but I have always grown a garden. And I insist that I’m
    going to plant one here,” replied Grandmother. She asked
    me if I would help her prepare the land for planting and I
    happily agreed.
    In early spring, she taught me how to start small seeds in
    containers inside. We put cabbages, onions, tomatoes,
    and radishes in the little seedling pots. I carefully watered
    them every day. Soon, little green sprouts appeared.
    When the days were warm enough, we transplanted the
    seedlings into neat rows in the small garden in the
    backyard. When everything was planted, my grandmother
    and I stood back and looked lovingly at the newly planted
    garden.
    “In a month, we will have fresh radishes to eat,” said
    Grandmother happily. “And a few weeks after that, we will
    have plenty of fresh vegetables for our supper table.” Of
    course, as my father pointed out, we did not need the food
    from Grandmother’s garden. But I am so glad to have
    spent those days looking after our plants in the summer
    heat.
    When autumn arrived, we harvested the food.
    Grandmother made sure we always had something fresh
    on the supper table.
    Now that I’m older and living on my own, I still remember
    those wonderful meals with great fondness.

    I Should Have Stayed in Bed!
    Have you ever heard the expression “Some days it’s just
    better to stay in bed”? Well, I had one of those days last
    week. It was the day for school pictures, and my mother
    had laid out my best clothes.
    After I got dressed, before I could do anything, the cat
    needed to be fed, so I gave him some food. Normally, that
    would keep him quiet, but that day, he was still excited
    about something.
    I sat down to breakfast and began to eat. My mother was
    making my lunch. She opened the closet door and
    suddenly let out a scream that made me jump up so fast
    that I spilled my bowl of cereal all over my good clothes.
    “Ahhhh! A mouse! It’s a mouse!” shouted my mother.
    You know it’s funny. My mother loves animals. We have a
    fish, a cat, a dog, a rabbit and even an iguana -- but, she
    hates mice. She quickly jumped up on a chair and told me,
    “Get a box! Get a broom! Get something!”
    I went to get a box, but just at that moment, our dog came
    running into the room to see what all the excitement was
    about. He saw the milk I had spilled on the floor and ran
    towards it just as I was going the other way. One of us had
    to slip, and it was me.
    I fell over and knocked my mother off the chair. I guess all
    the noise scared the mouse. It started running across the
    floor, but the cat grabbed it in its mouth and ran off!
    As a result of all this, my school picture shows me with a
    bruised cheek. On top of that, my mother sprained her
    ankle. Sometimes I wonder if the cat planned the whole
    thing?
    You know what? Maybe I should have just stayed in bed.

    Who Wins?
    My mom loves to feed the birds. Every autumn, she puts
    up a bird feeder. She buys bird food at the store. Then,
    she fills up the feeder and waits for the birds to come. She
    looks out our window and watches all the wonderful birds
    coming to feed there.
    There is a problem, though. Every year the squirrels come
    and steal all the bird seeds. It really frustrates my mom.
    “Why do they think they can steal all the bird food?” she
    says. “If I wanted to feed the squirrels, I would set up a
    squirrel feeder.”
    Over the years, Mom has tried every trick in the book to rid
    herself of the pesky squirrels. But squirrels are very
    intelligent animals. They are also good climbers. And they
    can jump really far when they need to.
    Mom erected barriers to try to keep the squirrels away.
    She put up a wire fence. But the squirrels just found a way
    to jump over it. Squirrels could even dig underneath it if
    they really wanted to.
    Mom didn’t give up easily though. She went on the
    Internet and read all about the problem with squirrels
    stealing from bird feeders.
    She discovered there was only one foolproof method to
    get rid of them: live trapping. Yes, that’s right! You catch
    the squirrel in a trap. It doesn’t hurt the squirrel at all. It’s
    just a small cage. Mom borrowed one from the local
    animal shelter.
    This is how the trap works. You put some food inside the
    trap. The squirrel comes in to eat and the door closes. The
    squirrel is inside and cannot escape. Then, you take the
    squirrel away from your house.
    Mom caught the squirrel in the live trap. She drove it
    outside of the city and let it go free.
    Now, only birds come to Mom’s bird feeder. She is happy.
    The birds are happy. And of course, the squirrel is happy
    living in the countryside where there is always plenty to
    eat.

    One-Way Traffic
    (adapted from a European tale)
    Have your heard the story of the lion and the fox? It is an
    interesting story. Listen carefully and learn about a fox that
    was smarter than a lazy lion.
    There was once a lion, who was too lazy to hunt or fight
    for his food. He was getting old. He said to himself, “Why
    should I work so hard to get food?” He was the king of the
    jungle. He would use his wits and intelligence.
    After much thinking, he devised his plan. It was simple
    enough. He knew that most animals in the jungle would be
    afraid of him. After all, lions are great hunters. All the
    creatures fear them naturally. He would appeal to the
    goodness of the other animals. He would appeal to their
    natural desire to help a fellow creature who was suffering.
    And so, the lion lay down at the entrance to a cave,
    pretending to be ill. Whenever any animals came by, he
    would say, “I am weak and lonely. I cannot rise or even
    open my jaws. Please come and help me.” The
    unsuspecting animals approached, for they wanted to help
    a fellow creature. When they got close enough, the lion
    grabbed them and ate them.
    Many good creatures disappeared this way. A fox who had
    seen through the trick came and stood at a distance from
    the cave and asked, “How are you, lion?” “Not well,” the
    lion answered, pretending to be weak. “Why do you not
    come in for a visit?”
    “I would come in,” said the fox. “But, I noticed a lot of
    tracks going into your cave and none coming out.”
    The fox then went about warning all the other animals. In
    this way, his powers of observation saved many lives.

    What Type Is Your Blood?
    Accidents happen every day. The unfortunate victims are
    rushed to hospitals where doctors do their best to save
    their lives. Often, being able to replace the victims’ lost
    blood, using a blood transfusion, is the only hope for
    survival.
    Blood transfusions have become a real lifesaver in
    modern medicine. But not so long ago, blood transfusions
    were dangerous and killed as many people as they saved.
    That is, until 1901, when an Austrian scientist discovered
    that humans do not all have the same blood type. His
    research demonstrated that humans, in fact, have one of
    four blood types -- A, B, AB and O.
    Before the discovery of the four blood types, it was
    believed that you could give the blood of any person to
    any other person. But this was not true. Giving a person
    the wrong type of blood often leads to death because the
    two different blood types are not compatible -- they fight
    each other.
    When giving a blood transfusion, doctors need to know
    the blood type of the person who donated the blood (the
    donor), and the blood type of the person who will be
    receiving it (the recipient).
    No matter where you live on this planet, your blood will fall
    into one of the four types. Some blood types are rarer than
    others. In European cultures, the most common blood
    type is O. Among Asian populations, the B blood type is
    common, while it is very rare in European populations.
    People with type O blood are “universal donors”. Their
    blood can be given safely to people from any of the other
    three groups. People with type AB blood are “universal
    recipients”. They can receive blood from any of the other
    three groups.

    The Elephant and the Wind
    (adapted from a traditional Indian story)
    There once lived a beautiful white elephant, and everyone
    in the land sought her out just to have a look. The news
    travelled all over the land and eventually reached the king.
    The king wished to have this elephant for himself, so he
    sent his men deep into the forest to find her. After many
    months, the king’s men discovered where she lived, put
    her in chains and led her back to the king.
    The king wanted to make the elephant obey. He ordered
    his trainers to make her tame. But, try as they might, the
    elephant could not be trained. Maybe she could not
    understand the language. Perhaps she was stubborn. But
    this only angered the trainers. They beat her and pierced
    her until her skin was black and blue and purple and red
    from the beatings.
    The elephant rose up one day and broke her chains. She
    charged through the palace, frightening everyone. She
    then broke through the gates and made her way deep into
    the forest. She travelled for months, fearing the king’s men
    might recapture her. But they gave up their pursuit, and
    returned to the palace.
    The elephant could not make the memory of her abuse go
    away. Every time the wind blew in the trees, she became
    frightened, causing her to run, bumping into trees and
    branches and rocks. She became black and blue and red
    again from all of the running in fear.
    Then one day, the wind blew again and she started
    running as usual. After running for many hours in fear, the
    elephant came to rest against a special tree in which the
    Buddha lived. The Buddha could feel her great fear. He
    said to her, “The wind moves the clouds in the sky but it is
    not your enemy. Do not be afraid of the wind, for it cannot
    hurt you. Your fear is in your mind. Look there and you will
    find it.”
    The elephant immediately understood what he was telling
    her. She began to breathe easily and she never lived in
    fear again.

    Facing My Fear
    When I was a kid, I was afraid of water. My brothers and
    sisters, on the other hand, were just like fish. They loved
    water. They loved to jump in pools or lakes and swim all
    day. But not me.
    Whenever I was close to water, my body shook with fear.
    On hot summer days, all my friends said, “Hey! Let’s go
    cool down in the river.” And away they went. Me? I stayed
    home.
    When we were younger, my parents took us all for
    swimming lessons. I made a fuss, crying and screaming.
    Finally, my parents said I could stay home while my
    brothers and sisters learned how to swim.
    Then, when I was ten years old, I spent a summer
    vacation with my grandparents in the countryside. They
    had cows, sheep, pigs, chickens and best of all -- a horse.
    I loved that horse. There was only one problem. Each day,
    I had to take him down to the river for a drink of water.
    Can you imagine how that turned out?
    The first day, I led it to the river. But when I got close to the
    water, my old fear got the best of me. I turned back.
    Grandpa saw that and said not to worry -- he would take
    the horse to the river.
    That night after supper, Grandpa told me to get a pair of
    shorts. He took me down towards the river. “I am going to
    teach you to swim,” he said. “You have nothing to fear.” He
    held my hand as we got close to the water.
    For some strange reason, I was not afraid. First, we sat by
    the water and just talked. I slowly got used to the water.
    Then, holding tightly to my grandfather’s hand, we walked
    into the water up to our knees. Gradually, after a few days,
    I was in the water, swimming with my grandfather. Can
    you imagine how good that made me feel?

    Quite a Family!
    There once was a man who lived in Russia in the 1800s.
    He was a respected teacher. He had a son who was a
    good teacher too. This son had two daughters.
    In the 1800s, many believed that women should not get a
    good education. Their destiny was to stay at home and
    have children. But the father knew his daughters were
    smart. Going against the norm, he sent them to university
    in Paris.
    One of these daughters married a scientist. The two
    worked together, trying to explain why certain rocks
    glowed and gave off energy. It seemed impossible to
    discover the reason why these strange rocks did this, but
    the couple worked tirelessly anyway.
    They had no idea that their research would eventually
    change the world. What was their discovery? Radiation --
    used today to treat cancer, a terrible illness.
    Unfortunately, they were unaware that these weird rocks
    were dangerous if not handled properly. The dust from the
    rocks got in their eyes and lungs, and made them sick.
    Back then, scientific discovery was very dangerous. Many
    scientists paid a huge price for their work for humankind.
    In fact, the woman eventually died as a result of working
    with these radioactive rocks. Her exposure to radiation
    was so bad that her notes from over one hundred years
    ago are still too dangerous to handle. They are kept in
    lead-lined boxes. The only way for people to safely view
    them is to wear protective clothes to shield them from
    radioactive poisoning.
    This woman, the daughter and granddaughter of teachers,
    became the first female professor at the University of
    Paris. She lived and died for learning, and her selfless
    dedication to science was rewarded in the end. She was
    the first person to win two Nobel Prizes in two different
    fields.
    Her name? Marie Curie.
    Marie had a daughter who also went on to win a Nobel
    Prize.
    Quite a family!

    Treasure Hunt
    Do you know what my friend Jesse and I did this past
    Saturday? We went hunting for treasure. Were we on a
    pirate ship sailing the Caribbean Sea? Not at all.
    Jesse and I went around our neighbourhood, looking at
    the stuff in yard sales. You wouldn’t believe the great
    things we found and the great fun we had!
    The yard sale in our neighbourhood is one of the biggest
    in the region. It started with only a few families, but now all
    families within a few square kilometres participate. With
    more people being aware of the environmental issues
    facing us, this event becomes very popular. People even
    come from out of town.
    Each family puts out things such as books, clothes, tools,
    furniture and even cookware. They hope other people will
    find another use for the things that they no longer need.
    The day was hot. We got up early and began walking. We
    stopped at Ms. Toss’s house first. Her son was leaving for
    college this year. There were a lot of things he no longer
    needed. He had a whole bunch of video games and
    books. We went through his collection and guess what? I
    found one of my favourite books. All I had to pay was a
    quarter. What a deal!
    We moved on to other houses. The street was packed
    with people. Everyone was happy. Think about it. It’s really
    good for the environment and for people too. Instead of
    filling up the landfill, many people find other uses for
    things that might be considered garbage.
    The next time you feel like an adventure, check out a yard
    sale: It’s fun, and it’s a great way to reuse things and
    reduce garbage.

    Delicious Green Cake
    My best friend Bill told me something really cool. His mom
    is always trying to figure out ways to give the environment
    a helping hand. What did she do this time? Well, it started
    simply enough.
    One day, she brought a green cake to work. At lunch, she
    shared her cake with her co-workers. “Delicious!”
    “Wonderful!” Everyone liked the cake. They were all
    curious how she made this cake.
    The story goes back a few weeks. Her city started a new
    recycling program -- households were supposed to
    separate food garbage from the rest of the household
    waste.
    Bill’s family loves fruit. His father especially loves
    watermelons. He eats a lot of them in the summer. The
    shell and skin always end up in the garbage. That’s almost
    half the weight of a watermelon!
    One day, after seeing the garbage man working hard to
    pick up the heavy garbage pail, Bill’s mother said, “Surely,
    I can find a better way to use all the melon skins.”
    After a lot of thinking, she brought out the blender and cut
    the melon skin into small pieces. Then, she blended them.
    She got a whole cupful of liquid -- green nutritious
    watermelon juice!
    The juice was full of vitamins. She didn’t want to waste it
    by pouring it down the sink. Instead, she mixed the juice
    with flour. From there, she carefully made her delicious
    GREEN cake.
    Once she tasted the first bite, she immediately knew her
    cake was a great by-product of the melon eating. And it
    was nature friendly too.
    From now on, she doesn’t need to worry about the heavy
    waste generated from eating melons. And everyone
    always wants more of her special cake.

    Silk: Stronger Than You Think
    Silk. It’s soft and smooth. It’s cool in summer and warm in
    winter. It’s pretty and comfortable to wear.
    Long ago, only rich people could afford silk. It was
    discovered by the Chinese thousands of years ago. Soon,
    worldwide trade of this precious fabric developed. Over
    the years, it has made many people very rich.
    But silk is no longer just a pretty fabric. Today, scientists
    are discovering many exciting things about silk. For
    example, silk is so strong that researchers believe it can
    be used to make bulletproof vests. In fact, silk is stronger
    than steel. A three-centimetre strand of silk is strong
    enough to raise a jet into the air and hold it there.
    But there’s a problem. It’s difficult to get enough natural
    silk for mass production. The silk worm makes about 700
    metres of silk when it spins its cocoon. That might seem
    like a lot, but imagine how many cocoons it takes to spin a
    long, thick cord.
    Scientists are studying the silk spun by spiders as an
    alternative to that of the silk worm. It’s strong too. But the
    problem is figuring out how to get enough of it to make it
    useful.
    Spiders don’t like to live near other spiders. They fight
    each other if there are too many in one place. This makes
    it difficult to raise spiders together and harvest their silk.
    This is why scientists are experimenting by adding special
    genes to some animals to see what happens.
    They put a silk gene in goats and found that their milk has
    a certain amount of silk in it. Still, it would take more than
    1,200 litres of this milk to make enough silk for one
    bulletproof vest. That’s a lot of milk!
    Ants and bees also produce silk. This is also being
    studied. But the problem remains -- how can you get
    enough silk for mass production of useful products other
    than fabrics?
    By the way, did you know that sleeping on a silk pillow is
    supposed to slow down the development of wrinkles on
    your face as you age?
    It’s the amino acids in the silk.

    Taking Care of Elsie
    Ever since I was a little girl, I had begged my parents to
    give me a puppy. They wouldn’t because they felt it was
    too much work and they had enough to do in their busy
    days.
    But when I got a little older, they did get me a puppy.
    Before they picked up the dog, they gave me a piece of
    paper. My dad looked at me and said, “This is a contract.
    It says that you agree to take care of this dog -- take it for
    walks every day, feed it, give it baths and play with it. She
    is your dog, and you are responsible for her.”
    “If you sign this, it means you promise to do everything
    mentioned on this paper,” my mother added. “Do you
    understand?”
    It was a lot of responsibility, but I agreed and signed the
    paper. Finally, I had my own dog! She was beautiful, even
    though she was just a ball of fur. I named her Elsie, and
    we instantly became the best of friends. I quickly realized
    that she thought I was her mother.
    She would cry at night just like a baby, and it was up to me
    to comfort her and put her back in her little bed. Soon, she
    started to sleep in my bed. This did not impress my mother
    very much.
    I had to walk her, play with her, and train her. There were
    times when this was frustrating, especially when I wanted
    to play with my friends. Instead, I had to do things for
    Elsie.
    Two years have passed now, and Elsie is all grown up.
    She weighs about 30 kilograms, and she’s as strong as a
    horse.
    One day, a neighbour asked me to babysit her kids for a
    few hours. When the lady came home, we were playing
    with Elsie in the yard. She asked me, “How did you learn
    to be such a good babysitter?”
    I pointed to Elsie with a smile and said, “I’ve raised her
    since she was a puppy. Compared to her, kids are easy!”

    Why I Play Sports
    Some people have no interest in sports. They say that
    sports make you sweat and smell bad. They say, “Why
    waste time playing sports?” To these people, I politely say,
    “You have not discovered the fun of sports!”
    Let me take you through a game I played recently, and
    share the ups and downs of the game with you. It was a
    basketball championship game in our city, and a lot of
    people were watching. Our parents and friends were there
    to cheer us on. We wanted to make a good impression.
    Most of all we wanted to win in front of the hometown
    crowd.
    The game was nearly over and we were down one goal.
    Our best player called us together and said, “Okay, this is
    it! Either we score now or the game is over. Let’s give
    whatever it takes to score and if we don’t, then at least we
    know that we have tried our very best.”
    This little speech said it all. Why? Because I feel it really
    doesn’t matter if you lose, as long as you give everything
    in trying. That is a life lesson that sports can teach us.
    Well, in the last minute of the game, we did score and tied
    the game! We went into overtime and we lost in the end.
    But in the locker room after the game, the coach said he
    had never seen a team try harder than us.
    So my advice to you is to play sports regularly. Pick
    something that focusses your mind and energy and stick
    with it. Your body will thank you and your mind will be
    ready to work better afterwards.
    Above all, give it your best each time you are out there.
    That’s why I love sports, and that’s why I play them
    whenever I get the chance.

    He’s Healthier Than Before!
    Our neighbour, Mr. Jones, used to weigh over one
    hundred kilograms. His doctor told him to lose some
    weight. “You are not healthy. Your blood pressure is high,”
    said his doctor.
    Mr. Jones worked as a security guard. He sat for many
    hours in a day. It wasn’t a surprise to see him overweight.
    After getting this bad news, Mr. Jones was frightened. He
    really needed to lose weight. First, he tried to eat less, but
    soon after, he felt hungry again. He could not stand the
    hunger and he had to grab some snacks. He ended up
    eating more, not less.
    Then he went to the drugstore to look for a solution. He
    was suggested to take diet pills. Soon, he changed his
    mind because they were too expensive and he knew that
    they could not be good for his health.
    After three months of trying really hard, he still weighed a
    little over one hundred kilograms. He was very unhappy.
    Then one day, after listening to a radio program, he had
    an idea that might solve his problem.
    At the supper table, he announced to the whole family that
    he was going to walk to work, beginning the next day. He
    would walk about eight kilometres every day.
    Everyone, including his children, listened to him in
    surprise. But Mr. Jones was very firm. “Every day, I’ll walk
    one hour in the morning, and another hour in the evening,”
    he said. “I will change the way I live.”
    The whole family got excited about his new plan. They all
    wanted to support him. The next morning, after having a
    good breakfast prepared by his wife, he left home for work
    one hour earlier than usual.
    It did not happen right away. But slowly, Mr. Jones lost
    some weight. At the end of one month, he lost three
    kilograms, which was a big reward and encouragement to
    him. Everyone in his family was encouraged by the result.
    After one year, he lost about 35 kilograms. He felt a lot
    better. He began to feel healthy again.

    The Old Man and the Wolf
    (adapted from a Chinese tale)
    Have you ever met an ungrateful person? You do a favour
    for him, and he does not thank you. In fact, he takes
    advantage of your kindness. Listen to this story about a
    thankless wolf and a wise man. There is much you can
    learn from it.
    There once was an old and gentle man. Everyone in his
    town knew that he was kind. He helped anyone who
    needed help. He was always willing to protect the weak
    and downtrodden.
    One day, this old man was walking down the street,
    enjoying the wonderful day. Suddenly, a wolf ran up to
    him. “Quick! Please hide me,” cried the wolf. “The hunters
    are coming. They will capture and kill me. I will repay your
    kindness.”
    Hoping only to save a life, the kind old man emptied his
    bag and placed the wolf inside. He covered the wolf gently
    with his belongings. “Make not a sound,” said the old man.
    “I will protect you, and you will be safe.”
    Soon, the hunters approached. Knowing the old man well,
    they tipped their caps to him, wished him a good day and
    continued their search.
    When they were out of sight, the old man released the
    wolf. Immediately, the wolf showed his true colours. He
    bared his teeth and growled, “Now that I am safe, I shall
    eat you.”
    “But what about the kindness you promised?” asked the
    old man.
    “What are you talking about? Kindness! I couldn’t even
    breathe in your bag.”
    The old man was both kind and wise. “You were unable to
    breathe? That is too bad. Please show me.”
    The wolf jumped into the bag. Quickly, the old man closed
    the bag. He secured the top, and went looking for the
    hunters.

    Saving for a New Car
    Our family doesn’t have a lot of extra money. My dad
    works and my mom stays home and makes extra money
    sewing clothes for people. She’s an expert seamstress.
    A while back, our family car was so old that it couldn’t last
    another year. It was time to buy another car, but my dad
    kept saying we didn’t have enough money. My parents
    would see a used car, and my dad would say, “We can’t
    afford it.” But my mom would always say, “We might be
    able to.”
    One day, they were at a car dealership and they saw a car
    they liked. As usual, my dad said, “We can’t afford it.” But
    my mom said, “Let’s go home and figure out if we can.”
    They did all the calculations, and they were about $1,000
    short. My mom asked us to follow her to the bedroom. We
    all went to the bedroom, and Mom pulled out a shoebox
    that was hidden on the closet shelf.
    She said to us, “When I was first married, my grandmother
    gave me advice about being married. She said: The best
    way is not to argue. Any time you get mad at your
    husband, instead of fighting, crochet yourself a little doll.”
    She opened the box, and inside were two crocheted dolls.
    My oldest sister said, “Wow, Mom. You and Dad have
    been married fifteen years, and you’ve only been mad
    twice?”
    “Well, not exactly,” my mom replied. She then pulled out a
    stack of money. “There is just enough here for us to get
    that car.” We all looked at the money and passed it around
    to each other. There was just over $1,000! We had never
    seen one thousand dollars before.
    “Where did all this money come from?” Dad asked. With a
    smile, Mom explained. “I was running out of room for all
    the dolls I had made over the years, so I sold them!”
    We all laughed, but my dad laughed the loudest. He knew
    that maybe he could be a little hard to live with sometimes.
    That night, we went and bought the car. It was one of our
    happiest moments.
    As we drove home, my dad was going a little too fast, so
    my mom said to him, “Slow down or I’ll start on a new
    doll!” We laughed all the way home.

    Trying New Things
    One day, I came home after school and threw my gym bag
    and volleyball down on the floor. I had tried out for the
    school volleyball team, and I didn’t make it. I felt terrible. I
    didn’t want to talk to anyone. I just lay on my bed. My
    mother tried to cheer me up, but nothing she did worked.
    Finally, my mother sent me to visit my uncle who lived
    around the corner. Off I went in my bad mood. I rang the
    bell. No answer. Then the door suddenly flew open.
    “ARRRRGGHHH!” a monster roared in my face! The mask
    came off, and Uncle Gerry said, “Still in a bad mood?” I
    guess my mother had told my uncle about my
    disappointment in not making the volleyball team. He
    decided to give me a little surprise. I didn’t want to admit it,
    but I felt better.
    Later on, over cookies and tea, he gave me some good
    advice. He said, “Tommy, I’m proud of you for trying out for
    the volleyball team. You know what I do? Every year, I
    make a promise to myself to try one new thing -- like a
    new sport, a new book or a new hobby. I even try to make
    a new friend each year. Trying new things helps you grow
    as a person.”
    It sounded interesting. I decided to try his theory as I
    made my way home that day. I took a different route than
    my usual one.
    I was walking by a school when, out of the comer of my
    eye, I saw some kids playing baseball. I thought about
    what my uncle had said, so I approached the kids. It took
    some courage, but soon I was playing with them and
    having fun. From then on, I played with them every week.
    A year later, I became a player on our school baseball
    team. I was a pitcher. And I’m still having fun playing
    baseball with my friends every week. I’m a happy player.
    And I found this happiness because I tried something new.

    Gunpowder
    Sometimes, the people who invent something have one
    idea in mind for their invention, but in the end, it gets used
    for something totally different. That’s the way it was with
    the invention of gunpowder many thousands of years ago.
    Some ancient Chinese scientists were mixing some
    ingredients together to form something they thought would
    make them live forever. They put their mixture on a small
    fire. But they had no idea that they had made a mistake.
    The mixture started to bubble and boil. Suddenly, it burst
    into flames, burning down their hut. Without knowing it,
    these ancient alchemists had made the first explosive.
    The ancient Chinese realized that something special had
    happened. They tried to figure out what they could do with
    this strange new mixture. It was dangerous, and clearly it
    would not give long life to anyone.
    After a long while, they found their answer. One day, after
    repeated failures with various mixtures, they added
    saltpetre and sulphur, two common materials. Poof! The
    mixture actually detonated. They were pleased with their
    accomplishment.
    The Chinese did not use their new creation for war.
    Instead, they made the first fireworks out of the newly
    invented substance. They used their fireworks as signals
    for many things such as that another army was
    approaching.
    They kept developing their creation. Finally, they designed
    a powerful weapon. They filled a hollow piece of bamboo
    with the powder. Then they stuffed arrows in it. These
    were the first rockets.
    That’s the way it is with inventions. The inventor gets an
    idea. As he figures out his invention, he has to try and
    experiment with different things. And sometimes he gets
    unexpected results.

    Tea Time
    My Aunt Susan is unusual to me. She is generous and
    kind, but best of all, she is funny. She always makes me
    laugh.
    Since her recent retirement, she has started drinking tea.
    She likes to discover all different kinds of tea. Green tea is
    her favourite. Each day, she drinks four or five cups.
    For her birthday this year, Mom gave her some new tea --
    tea from Africa. There were some words on the box: This
    tea is very good for your health. It will also make you more
    beautiful.
    Mom and Aunt Susan giggled. “Tea that will make you
    beautiful? I didn’t know that they grew tea like that,” said
    my aunt. “I will drink some now.” Mom made a cup of tea
    for Aunt Susan.
    The tea was dark green. It had some pretty white flowers
    in it. Aunt Susan sipped her tea slowly. “This tastes really
    good,” she said. She drank some more. Then she looked
    at me and asked, “Am I getting more beautiful?”
    We laughed. My aunt is very beautiful. She does not need
    tea to make her beautiful. Aunt Susan had another drink of
    the tea. She smiled and asked me again, “Am I getting
    more beautiful?”
    My aunt then said, “Maybe it takes time to become
    beautiful. I will be patient and wait.”
    It was funny. I love my Aunt Susan. “You ARE beautiful,” I
    said. Aunt Susan smiled. “Thank you, Joy,” she said. “You
    are beautiful too.”

    Learning to Sing
    I’ve always enjoyed singing, but I’m very shy. So when I
    heard that our church needed a female singer for the
    choir, I thought, “This is my chance to be a singer, but as
    part of a crowd, I didn’t want to be in the spotlight.”
    But once we got started, the choir master said we would
    have a few practices, and then I would have to do a solo.
    The word “solo” sent chills down my spine.
    I had been nervous all week about having to sing in front
    of these other singers. The night of the first practice, my
    mouth was dry and my stomach was in knots. I felt as if
    I might be sick.
    I saw the church, but I couldn’t go in. When I got home, I
    said to my mother, “I don’t want to be in some silly choir.”
    My mother knew I was lying.
    That night after dinner, I was doing the dishes with my
    father, and the doorbell rang. It was our choir leader.
    “Cathy,” she said, “if you won’t come to me, I’ll come to
    you! Put down that dish towel and come over here.”
    She sat down and gave me the music. At first, I sounded
    like a croaking frog. I took a drink. “Louder,” she said with
    a smile. I took a deep breath. She said, “Don’t let your fear
    keep you from being all you can be.” That made me think.
    Finally, I let it all out. I sang loudly and clearly. I was
    amazed. I had never sung in front of a person before. It
    felt really good.
    “Cathy,” the choir leader said. “I have some good news
    and some bad news. The good news is that you’re part of
    the choir. The bad news is that you will be the soloist.
    You’re too good to be in the back. Can you do it?”
    My stomach tightened into a knot, but deep down, I was
    happy. I had taken a big step in my life and it was because
    of singing.
    “Yes, I can do it,” I said. And I was right. I could.

    Somewhere Over the Rainbow
    You are playing outside on a rainy afternoon. The day
    clears, and the sun breaks through the clouds. If you’re
    lucky, a beautiful bow of light will spread itself out across
    the sky. Look up and enjoy. You are witnessing one of the
    wonders of nature -- a rainbow.
    In the West, adults teach young children that there is a pot
    of gold at the end of a rainbow. Most kids believe them.
    They look up at the perfect arc of light -- almost like a road
    on which they can walk. And they dream of one day
    finding that pot of gold. It’s a nice story. But rainbows
    really aren’t that mysterious.
    They are simply what we see when the sun’s rays pass
    through drops of water. The light is reflected and bent as it
    travels through the wet air. As light bends inside the
    raindrops, it comes out the other side, appearing as all of
    the colours of light: red, orange, yellow, green, blue and
    violet. The top band of light will always be red, and the
    bottom band will always be violet.
    There is no way to predict exactly when a rainbow will
    appear. However, if you see a rainbow, one thing is certain
    -- the sun is shining in one part of the sky and it is raining
    in another part of it. Here’s something else that’s always
    true about rainbows: they will always be in front of you,
    and the sun will always be behind you.
    Do you know that no two people see exactly the same
    rainbow? Suppose you and your friend spot a rainbow.
    You stand beside each other and marvel at its beauty. But
    each of you is seeing your own “one-of-a-kind” rainbow.
    Why? Easy. You are seeing light reflecting off one group of
    raindrops. Your friend is seeing light coming through
    different raindrops because she is seeing them from a
    different angle.
    One last thing. If there really was a pot of gold at the end
    of a rainbow, you would never be able to get there and
    discover it. As you move towards a rainbow, it moves
    away from you at the same speed.

    Brave David Kills a Giant
    (adapted from a Bible story)
    Long ago, in the far-off desert lands, two armies were
    lined up and facing each other for war. For forty days, they
    stood their ground, neither side attacking the other.
    Every day, a fierce and powerful giant, nearly four metres
    tall, came out of the camp of the Philistine army and
    roared across at the men in the army of Israel. His name
    was Goliath. He wore full-body armour, and his voice
    thundered across the desert, teasing and taunting the
    soldiers to come forth and fight him.
    The soldiers of Israel were frightened, and no one dared
    to go out to battle with this powerful man. And so, they
    stood and waited, neither side yet willing to attack the
    other.
    One day, a simple shepherd boy was sent to the front lines
    by the king to deliver a message. While he was there, the
    giant appeared, as he had done each day, and challenged
    the men of Israel. As before, no one took up the challenge.
    But the boy listened to the giant, and he desired to fight
    him and show the power of his nation.
    He went back to the king and begged permission to do
    battle with the giant. At first, the king would not agree, but
    in the end, he granted his permission. And so it was that
    the boy David came to fight.
    When Goliath came out on the 40th day, and teased the
    men, David walked onto the battlefield. “Who are you to
    mock this army?” he shouted. “I will fight you for I am not
    afraid.”
    David was dressed as a shepherd, with no strong armour
    to protect him. As the giant came towards him, David
    pulled a slingshot and stone from his pocket and aimed
    carefully. His stone found a hole in Goliath’s armour,
    knocking the giant to the ground. David ran forward,
    grabbed the giant’s sword and killed him.
    A cheer rose up from the army of Israel. The opposing
    soldiers ran away now that their giant was dead.

    Never a Perfect Mark?
    When I was in primary school, I enjoyed learning about
    interesting things. But one thing bothered me. I could
    never get a perfect mark on my math tests like some of
    the girls did.
    Every time I brought home my report card, before my mom
    read it, she could guess what the math score was – it had
    always been sitting just above 90. My mom even joked
    about it. She said, “Could you bring home a perfect mark
    just once?”
    One day, I talked to my mom about this. She asked me to
    think about why this was so. I thought about it. After a lot
    of thinking, I figured out what my problem was.
    “Mom, some questions are really simple. I know how to
    solve them right away. So I work them out fast.” “Oh?”
    Mom listened carefully. “Yes. They’re so easy that I get
    careless. And I make errors, like copying my answer with
    an extra zero. And I don’t check.”
    “I see,” Mom said. “When the questions are simple, you
    are not careful enough. So any error costs you the perfect
    mark.”
    She continued, “But I don’t think ‘copying an extra zero’ is
    a small error. If you are calculating a number for a
    spaceship, an extra zero may lead to a total failure of the
    launch.”
    “I see. I shall try to be fast and careful, too.” Our
    discussion continued. “How about the difficult questions?”
    asked Mom.
    “I try to solve them. But they are hard.”
    Mom laughed, “Difficult questions take a long time to
    solve. The first thing you have to do is to understand the
    question. Then you do your best to solve it. And you don’t
    give up easily, right?”
    Mom’s advice made it really easy. I could hardly wait until
    the next mathematics exam.
    You know what? A few weeks later, I did finally get a
    perfect mark!
