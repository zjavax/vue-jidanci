    A Day at the Beach
    My family and I live in England. England is not a very hot
    or sunny place. We do get sunshine, but it also rains quite
    a lot. So during the winter school break, many people go
    to places like Spain or Portugal to get some sun. That’s
    what we did last year and we’ll never forget it. I couldn’t
    wait to come back with a great tan to show off to my
    friends.
    We had two whole days at the beach. I was so excited!
    I was just starting to put sunscreen on, when we heard a
    siren. Someone was in trouble in the water! We ran over
    to where they were carrying a boy out of the water. He
    was taken away in an ambulance, but it was clear that he
    was okay.
    We all headed back to where our towels were, when my
    sister Kay said, “Race you to the water!” With that we were
    off.
    It was a very hot day and the sun was blazing. I was so
    happy. I got all the sun I could. We laughed and ran along
    the beach. We swam and played Frisbee.
    Finally, around noon, my mother called us to get some
    food. My family looked at me with shock. Parts of my body
    were white and parts were as red as a lobster! Shocked,
    my mother asked, “Didn’t you put on sunscreen?” I told
    her I did, but then I realized the siren had stopped me
    from covering my whole body.
    I was so badly burned that I had to stay inside for the rest
    of the two days we were there.
    When we arrived home, I didn’t even want to go to school.
    I was so embarrassed. But I went anyway. I wore long-
    sleeved shirts and long pants for three days until the burn
    went away. But even then, I was two different colours for
    weeks!
    My great beach vacation taught me the power of the sun
    and the power of sunscreen. Most importantly, it taught me
    that I shouldn’t be so worried about trying to change the
    way I look in the first place!

    The Watchmaker and the Baseball Player
    I live in a little town in Switzerland. I’m very old now, but
    when I was a boy of about twelve, there was an old
    watchmaker who made watches in his house. Every day,
    you would see him working at his table in his front window,
    making his watches.
    He made only a few watches every year because he
    made every piece himself. His name was Mr. Steinmach.
    He kept to himself and was not very popular because he
    was not very friendly.
    One day, some kids and I were playing baseball, and I hit
    a ball right through his front window where he worked.
    He came running from his house screaming that the watch
    he was working on was smashed! I was so scared that
    I didn’t have the courage to confess.
    Months passed. Then one day, when I was walking by his
    house, the baseball I had hit through his window rolled by
    my feet.
    “There’s your ball back!” I heard him call. “Keep it away
    from my house! You boys are lucky I was able to fix the
    watch.”
    I couldn’t take it any longer. I walked up to him and said,
    “Mr. Steinmach, it was me. I hit that ball through your
    window.”
    “Are you interested in paying for the damage?” he asked.
    I was shocked. I could never repay the price of one of his
    watches.
    “Not in money, but in work,” he said. I agreed.
    From that day on, I volunteered at the old watchmaker’s
    shop. And over the next year, he taught me the basics
    about making watches. Within a couple of years, I was
    working for him after school. I was learning to be a
    watchmaker.
    That was 60 years ago. Now, I’m the old watchmaker.
    When the young boys and girls play baseball, I do get a
    little nervous. But I go out there and take a turn. And I
    always think of old Mr. Steinmach and the lessons he
    taught me all those years ago.

    It’s There!
    Allison is a friend of mine who loves science. She loves to
    prove things using simple experiments. I, on the other
    hand, love reading and writing, but not science.
    One day she said to me, “We just learned about air
    pressure in our science class. I wonder how much you
    know about it?”
    “Not too much,” I confessed. She made a funny face.
    “If you fill a glass with water and put a piece of paper on
    top, and then turn the glass over, what will happen?”
    “You’ll get the floor wet,” I answered. “No. The water will
    stay in the glass,” she said.
    I told her to prove it. Allison loves a challenge.
    The next day, I met Allison at her house. She had a glass
    filled with water, and a small sheet of paper. She placed
    the paper on top of the glass and pressed down hard on
    the paper. Next, she held one hand on the paper and
    turned the glass over.
    I stood watching with a smile on my face. Surely all the
    water would spill onto the floor. “Are you afraid to move
    your hand?” I asked with a smug look. She didn’t answer.
    Suddenly, she took her hand away. I quickly stepped back,
    thinking my feet would get wet when the water rushed out
    from the glass. But nothing happened! Not a drop of water
    spilled from the overturned glass.
    Allison smiled. “See,” she said, “this little paper holds all
    the water back. Do you believe me now?” I should have
    known she would be right. “You can see that the paper
    holds the water back, but you can’t see why,” Allison
    continued. “It’s air pressure. It’s all around us, but we can’t
    see it. We can only see its effects. Air pressure on the
    paper holds it in place. It’s stronger than the gravity that is
    trying to force the water out.”
    As the expression goes, “Seeing is believing.” Now, I had
    to believe in the existence of air pressure. It’s something
    we can’t see, but it’s there.

    Silent Music
    Imagine this. You write music, but you can’t hear it.
    Impossible? It would seem impossible for most people, but
    not for one of the greatest composers in history.
    He was born in a small city in Europe in 1770. He was a
    great young talent and began performing in front of people
    when he was just nine years old. He met his idol, Mozart,
    when he was just a boy, and this inspired him to become a
    great piano player and a writer of music.
    He became a composer and was very famous and rich.
    But then, his life changed. When he was about 26 years
    old, he began to lose his hearing. He heard ringing in his
    ears that was so loud that he could not hear the music.
    He went to many doctors and tried many treatments and
    instruments to help him hear, but nothing worked very
    well. He even used a special rod that was attached to the
    piano. He would bite the rod, and that way he could feel
    the vibrations of the music in his head.
    As he lost more and more of his ability to hear, he began
    to use “talking books”. His friends wrote what they wanted
    to say, and he replied using a pen and paper.
    This man, who could not hear, wrote hundreds of pieces of
    music during his lifetime. Many people feel that his best
    composition was his Ninth Symphony.
    The night it was first played for an audience, he conducted
    the orchestra. When the music stopped, one of the
    musicians had to turn him around to see the audience
    clapping and cheering, for he did not hear them.
    The audience had heard one of the greatest pieces of
    music in history. But he cried, for he had heard nothing.
    Isn’t it amazing that a person can create such beautiful
    music and not hear it?
    The deaf man’s name was Ludwig van Beethoven, and his
    music will live on forever.

    A New Neighbour
    Across the street from where I live, there is a row of
    shabby, old parking garages. Most of these garages have
    cars in them year-round since the area is close to
    downtown and parking spaces are in high demand.
    But one summer, one of the garages was empty. The door
    didn’t work properly, and it would not close completely. I
    guess that’s why it wasn’t rented.
    One day, a person moved in -- an old man in his 70s. I
    suppose he noticed the open door and decided to move
    in. He had only a few possessions and they were all
    stacked in a shopping cart. He would walk around the
    neighbourhood picking up glass bottles and plastic
    containers. At the end of the day, he would separate and
    pack them. Later, he took them to the recycling depot.
    Of course, the garage had no heat and no water, but there
    was electricity. Sometimes he played music on his stereo,
    the only thing he had of any value. Because the garage
    door would not close completely, people could see inside
    as they walked by.
    Outside, he posted a piece of cardboard on which he had
    hand-written these words: Private! Video surveillance is
    on. Who knows? Perhaps he thought that thieves would
    be interested in his meagre possessions.
    Fall soon arrived. The days grew colder, and the leaves
    began to fall off the trees. One weekend, the man had a
    party at the garage. Nobody knew where he found all of
    the friends. They were drinking, singing, talking, and
    having a good time. Most of them stood outside the
    garage on the street.
    The man told his friends, “Don’t smoke. There are many
    leaves on the street and you might cause a fire.” You see,
    he was not an irresponsible person.
    But all did not end well. The next day, the property owner
    arrived with a truck and took away all the man’s
    belongings. The garage door was replaced with a brand
    new one, and a strong lock was installed to keep the man
    out.
    The street became quiet again, but I will always remember
    our summer neighbour.

    At the Border
    (adapted from a Middle Eastern folk tale)
    There’s an expression in English that says: “Sometimes
    you can’t see the forest because of all the trees.” Do you
    know what that means? It means that if you focus too
    much on the details, you might not be able to see the “big
    picture”.
    Such was the problem long ago at a border crossing far
    away. Smugglers are people who sneak things across
    borders illegally. The border agent’s job is to search for
    and find the items smugglers are hiding as they cross the
    border into a different country.
    One day, a smuggler leading a donkey approached the
    border. On the donkey’s back, there was a large load of
    straw. As the man came closer to the border, the agent
    grew suspicious. “Surely this man is trying to smuggle
    valuable goods into my country,” he thought.
    He stopped the smuggler and made him unload the hay.
    The agent searched through the hay but could not find
    anything. He could do nothing but allow the man with the
    donkey to pass. “You are a smuggler,” said the agent.
    “And one day, I will find what you are smuggling.”
    Every day for many years, the same man approached the
    border leading his donkey with the load of straw on its
    back. And every day, the agent searched in vain for the
    valuables that he was sure were hidden inside the hay.
    But try as he might, the agent was never able to find
    anything.
    Many years passed, and the agent retired. One day, he
    met the smuggler on the road. “I am retired now,” he said,
    “and I can do no harm to you anymore. What is it that you
    were smuggling all those years? I would very much like to
    know.”
    The smuggler smiled and said simply, “Donkeys.”
    And so it was. The agent had not seen the forest because
    of all the trees.

    Dr. Bethune: Unknown Treasure
    Sometimes, it takes a stranger to point out a great
    treasure nearby. This is especially true in the case of Dr.
    Norman Bethune -- the doctor who left his homeland in
    Canada to fight injustice wherever he found it in the world.
    Nearly every Chinese person has heard about Dr.
    Bethune and his selfless dedication to helping the Chinese
    during the war. However, this great hero does not enjoy
    such fame in Canada. In fact, until recently, he was nearly
    unknown in the country of his birth.
    In China, Dr. Bethune is honoured and loved for the
    tireless medical help he provided during the struggle
    against the invading army. When he died, he was buried in
    Shijiazhuang with full honours. Since then, statues have
    been erected in his honour. Schools have been named
    after him. Chairman Mao even wrote a moving speech
    entitled In Memory of Norman Bethune.
    But the picture is completely different in his homeland. For
    many years, Dr. Bethune was unknown to his fellow
    Canadians. No one erected a statue to honour him. In
    fact, for almost 35 years after his death, no one really
    cared about remembering him.
    Things are changing though. In 1973, the government of
    Canada purchased a house in Gravenhurst, Ontario
    where Dr. Bethune was born and raised. It was restored
    and converted into a museum in 1976. Slowly, people
    began to learn about Dr. Bethune. The more they learned,
    the more they came to respect him and his work in Spain,
    and later in China.
    While Canadians slowly learn about Dr. Bethune, the
    Chinese never forget him. When the Bethune House
    opened in 1976, the Chinese government presented a
    beautiful bronze statue of Dr. Bethune and members of
    the 8th Route Army. It is proudly displayed there to this
    day. Every year, many Chinese tourists and other visitors
    to Canada visit the Bethune House. They bring gifts and
    leave them there out of respect and love for the selfless
    doctor.
    That’s how it is sometimes. It takes a stranger to reveal a
    treasure that’s right in front of you.

    Dancing Goats?
    According to a legend, about a thousand years ago in
    Ethiopia, some shepherds noticed their goats dancing
    around after eating strange berries. They were full of
    energy and could not be calmed down.
    The local priest came and said that the “Devil” was in the
    berries, and he told them to burn the bushes. But the
    smell that came from the burning bush was so wonderful
    that the shepherds had to try the berries themselves. They
    found that the berries gave them energy!
    The shepherds didn’t realize that what they had
    discovered would one day become one of the most
    important crops in the world. It spread from Africa to Italy,
    and by 1500, it had spread to the rest of the world.
    It became popular in the United States when the
    Americans were at war with England, and the English
    refused to sell them tea.
    Today, over one hundred million people in poor countries
    make their living from these small berries, which are
    coffee beans. They’re grown all over the world, wherever
    there is enough heat and sun.
    The way coffee is grown is the same everywhere. Twenty
    seeds are placed in a hole at the beginning of the rainy
    season. And about half will grow. When they’re ripe, the
    berries are picked and dried. The seeds inside are roasted
    and then ground to make a powder.
    The word “coffee” comes from the Arabic word, Qahweh,
    which means “wine of the bean”.
    How powerful is it? Well, it has been used as a way to
    help adults wake up in the morning. And it’s powerful
    enough that children should never drink it. It can also
    make it difficult for people to sleep. Like many things, a
    little is okay, but too much can be unhealthy.
    There’s no doubt that it can give you that extra boost of
    energy to wake you up. Just ask a dancing goat.

    My Secret Weapon
    I love baseball. It’s my favourite sport. I play on the school
    team. And this year, I was given the great honour of being
    named captain.
    I can catch and throw well, and I’m a pretty fast runner.
    But my best ability is hitting. I have a good eye and I can
    hit most pitches.
    I wasn’t always such a good hitter. In fact, my hitting used
    to be my worst skill. When people ask me how I got so
    good, I tell them, “I learned from my woodworking
    teacher.”
    “Does he coach?” they ask.
    “No,” I say. “He doesn’t even know how to play baseball.”
    One day in woodworking class, we were all given
    hammers to practise driving long nails into pieces of wood.
    We were given ten nails each and safety glasses.
    Each of us took our turn. Everyone wanted to look the
    strongest, so we all swung the hammer as fast as possible
    to hit the nail.
    Many of us missed the nail or bent it, myself included.
    The teacher just stood back and watched with a smile.
    “My turn,” he said. He took the hammer. Although he was
    as small as us, he drove the long nails into the wood with
    just three hits while we took five or six.
    “The secret is to let the tool do the work,” he said. How
    effortless it was!
    “If a tool is well-designed, it will do most of the work for
    you. You don’t have to swing too hard,” he explained.
    Swing too hard. These three words rang in my ears.
    The next day at baseball practice, I relaxed and slowed
    my swing, instead of chopping at the ball. At the end of
    practice, I was hitting easily. I had learned a great lesson.
    So, next time when you’re working with tools of any kind
    or even playing baseball, remember: let the tool do the
    work. It’s safer and it’s fun.

    Insects Lend a Helping Hand
    Spiders, ants, flies, bees and grasshoppers -- these are
    just a few of the creatures in the insect world. Most of us
    avoid them when we can, but it’s not easy to do. You find
    them everywhere. Insects are earth’s most successful
    animals. Nearly 75 percent of all animals are insects.
    Many people think insects are scary. Long, thin legs and
    big, round eyes. Stingers that can really sting and bites
    that really hurt. Millions of dollars are spent every year in
    attempts to destroy them.
    To many people, they’re a nuisance -- something to get rid
    of. They’re different from us, so it’s easy to see why many
    people fear them. However, these little animals have some
    amazing abilities. Scratch the surface, and you will
    understand how special insects really are.
    Did you know, for example, that the silk spun by a spider
    is twice as strong as steel? On a weight-for-weight basis,
    spider silk is a tough material. One pound of spider web is
    two times stronger than one pound of steel. Imagine what
    we could do if we could figure out a way to make spider
    webs!
    Insects are natural recyclers, too. When living matter dies,
    insects have a major role in helping to break down this
    material and return it to the soil. Without insects, that dead
    material would take a long time to decompose. Insects
    speed up the process, turning garbage into useful nutrition
    for the soil.
    Insects contribute to our food supply too. It’s hard to
    imagine growing enough food to feed us all in a world
    without insects. They help plants reproduce by moving
    pollen from flower to flower.
    In medical labs, insects are helping us unlock the
    mysteries of genetics. Scientists study them because they
    have a short lifespan. Many generations can be studied in
    a short time.
    Insects truly are our friends and allies. A world without
    insects would look a whole lot different. Think about that
    the next time you see a bee buzzing quietly over a garden.

    The Wise Rabbit and the Lion
    (adapted from an Indian fable)
    Do you know what a bully is? It is someone strong and
    powerful, who uses his strength to frighten weaker people
    and get his own way. You find bullies everywhere, but if
    you apply your thinking skills, it is often quite easy to
    outwit a bully.
    Such was the case long ago in the jungle of India, where a
    mean lion lived. This bully knew he was the king of the
    jungle and used his great power to frighten the other
    creatures. He chased them constantly. When he caught
    one of them, he would instantly eat them, and that was the
    end of it. Then one day, the bully made a deal with them.
    “Each day, one of you will come willingly to my cave. I will
    eat you, and I promise not to chase the others,”
    commanded the lion bully. The others in the jungle had no
    choice but to accept this deal from the bully. What else
    could they do, after all? The lion was fast and strong, and
    they wished for peace in their land.
    On the first evening, a shy and timid rabbit was the first to
    go to the lion to be eaten so that the others could live
    without fear. He was late, and when he arrived at the lion’s
    home, the lion roared in anger, “You are late!”
    “I am so sorry,” explained the rabbit. “But as I was coming,
    another lion chased me.”
    “Another lion!” roared the bully. “This is my jungle. I will not
    tolerate this. Show me where this lion lives.”
    The rabbit took the lion bully to a large deep well. As the
    lion peered over the side of the well, he saw his own
    reflection in the water. He thought it was the other lion,
    and he roared fiercely, “Leave now, for I am the boss in
    this jungle.” Of course, his roar echoed back to him from
    deep in the well. Immediately, the bully jumped into the
    well to attack his rival. There was a pause and then a
    splash from the lion bully falling into the deep water.
    Thanks to the intelligence of the little rabbit, this bully met
    the fate that all bullies meet, sooner or later.

    My First Drive
    I was so careful. I was nervous too. I had taken driving
    lessons and passed my driving test. I now had my license.
    I had to pick up my father from work and drive him to the
    train station. I must have looked at the speedometer a
    hundred times that first trip. But as I got close to my
    father’s work, I felt more and more confident.
    There he was standing in front of his office building. His
    friends made jokes about me driving. They joked that they
    would never see my father again. He hugged them
    goodbye and pretended he was going on a very
    dangerous mission... a trip with his son driving the car!
    We all laughed.
    But then, I was nervous again. I had to pull the car into the
    street. With all the traffic, there weren’t many chances.
    After about two minutes of waiting, the way was finally
    clear.
    We got onto the highway and things settled down. My
    father was giving me some advice on how to change
    lanes. Suddenly, I saw flashing blue and red lights behind
    me. It was the police! They were pulling me over. “Oh no!”
    I said. “This is too embarrassing. I’ve been pulled over on
    my first trip as a licensed driver!”
    “What did you do?” my father asked. I told him I didn’t
    know. I could not believe that I was speeding because
    there were so many cars passing me. Obviously, they
    were going faster than I was.
    The police officer came to my window. I tried to smile, but I
    couldn’t. “The speed limit on these roads is 100 kilometres
    an hour,” he said. “Do you know how fast you were
    going?” I didn’t. “120?” I guessed.
    “No. You were going 65 kilometres per hour. You can’t
    drive that slow. You’ll cause an accident.”
    When he found out this was my first day driving, he
    laughed and said, “You know, I don’t get to say this very
    often, but I will tell you. Please go a little faster on these
    highways. Not too fast though.”
    He smiled and walked away. And that was my first day as
    a licensed driver.

    School Bullies
    In the end, things turned out okay. But I almost killed
    someone, and I still feel so guilty about what I did. I will
    carry this guilt with me for the rest of my life.
    I want to apologize for what I did, but the person I hurt is
    no longer at our school. I have no way of contacting her,
    and that makes me feel very bad. The girl -- I will call her
    Sally -- was the smartest girl in our class. She was not
    pretty and she was very shy. But she could answer any
    question the teacher asked. She always got top marks on
    exams.
    One day, as she was walking past my friends and me in
    the hallway, I said, “Hey. There goes ‘smelly pants’! You
    smell bad.” We all laughed. We thought it was funny. Sally
    said something defiant back to us, but I could see that my
    name-calling had really hit home. It hurt her, and I liked
    hurting her. “She thinks she’s so smart,” I was thinking to
    myself.
    After that, whenever we saw her, we called her names,
    different names, but names that were not nice. After a
    while, she gave up trying to say anything back to us. She
    stopped answering questions in class. The teachers would
    call on her, but she just looked at the floor and refused to
    answer.
    Then, one morning, the teacher announced that Sally
    would not be coming back to our school. She had found
    some pills and overdosed. Luckily, her mother found her
    and rushed her to the hospital. They pumped her stomach,
    and she got better.
    According to our teacher, Sally told the doctors that she
    had tried to kill herself because of the name-calling at
    school. She thought the only way to end her troubles was
    to end her life.
    I feel horrible. I am meeting with a school counsellor twice
    a week and trying to discover why I did such a terrible
    thing to a girl like Sally.
    She changed schools, so I can’t tell her how bad I feel.
    But I am going to speak out about bullying and how
    dangerous it is. Maybe I can save another person from
    going through what I put Sally through.

    A Father Returns
    (based on an African folk legend)
    Long ago, on the plains of Africa, a powerful chief went
    hunting. He was the greatest hunter in his village, and he
    always returned with good meat after a full day stalking
    wild animals near his village.
    But on this fateful day, the chief did not return to his village
    when the sun had set.
    Everyone in the village was upset. For a few days, his
    family wailed and cried. But in the end, they gave up hope
    for the return of their father, and life returned to normal.
    However, the youngest son could not forget. He cried day
    and night for his father, asking where he was and why he
    did not return. Finally, when the other brothers could take
    no more of it, they agreed to go looking for their father.
    Soon, they came upon their father’s hunting knife lying on
    the ground. Shortly after, they found his bones, which
    were already turning white from the high African sun.
    These brothers had special powers, and decided to use
    them to bring their dead father back to life.
    One son put the bones back together into the form of a
    man. Another son put flesh and skin on the skeleton.
    Then, the eldest son knelt over his father, and breathed
    into his mouth to give life back to him.
    The chief awoke. He walked with his sons back to his
    village. The people were joyous, and they held a huge
    feast to celebrate the return of the chief.
    The chief declared that he would give a fine gift to the son
    who had brought him back to life. “Give it to me!” cried one
    son. “No, to me!” cried another. The eldest cried that he
    should receive the gift as it was he who had done the
    most to bring his father back to life.
    But then, the chief turned to his youngest son. “I give this
    gift to you, my boy. It is you who truly brought me back to
    life. We are not really dead until everyone forgets about
    us, and it was you who did not forget.”

    A Shocking Story
    Let me tell you something very important: Never have
    water near you when you have something electric nearby!
    Last year, my family had a close call that nearly changed
    our lives forever.
    My brother Tom had just received a new train set. We
    decided to build a little “world” for it with mountains,
    valleys, streetlights and even a lake. We found a large
    board that was big enough to hold the train. Then we
    started to build. We spent over a week building the
    landscape out of paper mache and cardboard.
    We wanted to have a lake for our landscape, but it would
    take a long time to make one. We’d have to use cement,
    and that would take another day. Instead, we decided to
    use a box and put a garbage bag in it and fill it with water.
    We cut a hole in the board, and we placed the box
    underneath. Now we had our lake! We even put a boat in
    it.
    Later that day, we showed everyone our new train set with
    all the buildings, mountains, and tunnels. It was very
    realistic. Now, it was time to turn it on. I flipped the switch
    and the train began to move. Everyone was clapping.
    I turned to look at Tom and he looked strange. He was
    shaking. He was not smiling.
    “Tom!” I yelled. He didn’t move. He was standing really
    still, looking straight ahead.
    Suddenly, my dad realized what was happening. He
    reached frantically for the switch and turned off the train.
    The water had leaked from the bag under the board and
    soaked the rug where Tom was standing. One of our wires
    for the little street lights had fallen under the table and was
    touching that water.
    We called an ambulance. And luckily Tom was fine. He
    told us that when the electricity was on he could not move
    a muscle!
    We learned a lesson that day. Never mix electricity and
    water! It’s a deadly combination.

    It’s Never Too Late to Change (I)
    Nearly everyone is familiar with the five famous Nobel
    Prizes given annually for excellence in physics, chemistry,
    medicine, literature and peace.
    But many would be surprised to learn that Alfred Nobel,
    the father of the most prestigious prize in the world, was
    also the inventor of dynamite and made most of his
    fortune as an arms builder and seller. Through his many
    factories in more than twenty countries, he fuelled the
    armies and wars of Europe in the late 19th century.
    “How could this man be responsible for the peace prize?”
    you might ask. It’s a natural question that many have
    asked since Nobel’s death in 1896. The answer provides
    us with some insight into the old wisdom that it’s never too
    late in life to change.
    Had it not been for a remarkable event late in Alfred
    Nobel’s life, the world would remember him only as a
    weapons inventor and arms dealer. However, as an old
    man, a simple twist of fate led him to make a decision that
    resulted in the Nobel prizes.
    When one of Nobel’s brothers died, the newspapers in
    Sweden, Nobel’s home country, mistakenly reported that it
    was Alfred who had died. As is common when a rich or
    influential person passes away, the newspapers print
    obituaries. An obituary is an article that describes the life
    of someone who has died, and outlines some of that
    person’s accomplishments.
    The newspapers said some rather unpleasant things
    about Alfred. One writer said that the work of Alfred Nobel
    had made it possible for humans to kill each other more
    quickly and in greater numbers than ever before. Not
    exactly what an old man might want to hear about his life’s
    work.
    It isn’t often that someone gets to read his obituary while
    he’s still alive. Imagine what Alfred Nobel must have
    thought as he was reading it. He could not have been
    pleased that this was how the world and history would
    remember him long after he was gone.
    But Alfred Nobel was about to make a decision that would
    change the world for the better.
    6-17
    It’s Never Too Late to Change (II)
    Alfred Nobel, one of the richest men in Sweden, did not
    want to be remembered as a destroyer. Upon learning
    how the world would remember him when he died, he
    immediately decided to write a new last will and
    testament. In his will, he outlined his wishes for what
    would happen to his money after his death.
    Nobel decided it was not too late to change. He was
    determined to use his great wealth to accomplish good in
    the world. The Nobel prizes, especially the peace prize,
    were his way of trying to make the world a little better.
    He left nearly all of his vast fortune to set up and maintain
    the Nobel prizes to honour people who do great things for
    humanity, and to encourage good will around the world.
    Nobel’s one-page will was simple and straightforward. In
    it, he described the prizes he wanted to establish and
    what people must do to win them.
    As a result of Nobel’s life-changing experience, each year,
    five prestigious prizes are awarded to distinguished
    scientists, and men and women who promote peace
    around the world.
    Since 1901, prizes have been given in three scientific
    areas: chemistry, physics, and medicine or physiology.
    There is also a prize for literature. And of course, there is
    the best-known prize of them all, the Nobel Peace Prize.
    The winners receive a gold medal, a diploma, and some
    money. They receive their medals from the King of
    Sweden.
    A few years after writing this will, Alfred Nobel died at the
    age of 63. He had no way of knowing how famous the
    Nobel prizes would become. One thing is certain though:
    it’s never too late to change. Just look at the life of Alfred
    Nobel.
    He could have been remembered as an arms dealer and
    destroyer. Instead, his name stands for good things like
    world peace, science and great literature.

    Dad, the Handyman
    My dad decided that he wanted to be a handyman. He
    said that the man of a family had to be a handyman. In his
    mind, it’s an obligation and part of a man’s nature to be
    able to fix things around the house. My mom loved that
    idea. She gave him full support whenever he had the urge
    to fix something.
    Dad’s handyman endeavours started with our bicycles.
    We have two bicycles. One is new, and the other is old.
    The newer one had a loose pedal and the brakes didn’t
    respond to a quick stop. Dad decided to take parts from
    the old bicycle, to make a perfect one for me. He spent the
    whole morning removing the pedals and brakes from the
    old bike. But then, Dad couldn’t get the parts installed
    properly on my bike. Not only this, but he couldn’t put the
    parts back on the bike he had dismantled either. Now,
    neither of the bikes worked.
    It was discouraging for Dad. He stopped thinking about his
    handyman glory for a while.
    Not long after, he noticed that a wall in the living room had
    some scratches on it. He decided to paint the wall to
    freshen up the room. That seemed like an easy job. After
    buying the paint, the rollers and the brushes, he started
    painting the wall.
    Once he began painting, Dad discovered that the rollers
    and brushes left marks on the wall no matter how careful
    he was with each stroke. Instead of painting the entire
    room, he did only one wall, leaving brush marks here and
    there if you looked at it sideways.
    Dad’s dream doesn’t die easily. He is still trying to become
    a handyman. Recently, he changed the bulb in the kitchen
    after removing the glass cap. He was so happy with his
    success.
    Mom and I watched a TV show called The Worst
    Handyman in Canada. We think we will nominate my dad
    to receive this title.
    Don’t get me wrong. We love Dad dearly. And we love the
    way he tries to be the head of the household -- even if his
    handyman skills need a bit of an upgrade.

    An Honest Man’s Reward
    (adapted from a traditional Middle Eastern fable)
    There is a saying that “honesty is the best policy”. Tell the
    truth and good things will happen. This is just the way it is.
    Long ago, a homeless man was walking in a busy market.
    On the ground in front of him, he spied a leather purse.
    Upon opening it, he found 100 shiny gold coins inside. The
    beggar was hungry. He had no home. He had nothing in
    the world but the clothes on his back. He was tempted to
    conceal the money purse under his shirt and not to tell a
    soul about his find.
    Suddenly, he heard the cry of a rich man, running through
    the market. “I have lost my money bag!” he shouted. “I
    offer a generous reward to anyone who finds it and returns
    it to me.”
    The homeless man approached the rich man and gave
    him back his money. Then, he asked if he might have the
    reward for finding it.
    However, the rich man had other plans. He opened the
    bag, looked inside, and said, “There are only 100 gold
    coins inside. The purse I lost had 200 gold coins. You
    must have stolen the rest. You will have no reward from
    me.” The beggar demanded that they go to court to settle
    the matter.
    A wise judge heard both men tell what had happened.
    Then he said, “This is good. I have come to my decision. I
    think you are both telling the truth. Rich man, you say you
    lost a purse containing 200 gold coins. However, the
    beggar found a purse containing only 100 gold coins. I
    conclude that this purse cannot be the one you lost, for
    you say it had 200 coins inside.”
    As was the custom in those days, the judge gave the
    money purse to the person who had found it, as no rightful
    owner had come forward to prove it was his.
    And that is why, in the end, honesty truly is the best policy.

    What’s in a Name?
    Have you ever thought about how people get their
    names? Let’s learn a little history about family names in
    North America. People in North America have two names.
    Their first name is given to them by their parents. Their
    last name is the same name that their parents have. It is
    the family name.
    Long ago, however, people had only one name. A man
    could be called simply John or Peter. A woman could be
    called Mary or Elizabeth. After some time, there were too
    many people with the same name. Everyone was
    confused, so second names were needed.
    Children began taking their father’s name as a last name.
    In this way, children of John were called, for example,
    Peter and Mary Johnson. Names such as Jackson,
    Anderson and Davidson came into use.
    Mac means “son of”, so the name MacGregor means son
    of Gregory, and MacDonald means son of Donald. Fitz is
    another way of saying “son of”. So Fitzpatrick and
    Fitzgerald mean son or child of Patrick or Gerald.
    Some people got their names from the places where they
    lived. For example, a family living in a village with many
    green trees and plants might take the name Green. If they
    lived in a town called Moor, they might be called the
    Moores.
    Sometimes, people got their names from the way they
    looked. A tall person was perhaps called Long. If people in
    a family had dark hair, the family was sometimes called
    the Blacks or the Browns. If their hair was light, they may
    have been called the Whites.
    People also took their names from the kind of work they
    did. A person who sewed clothing was named Taylor. A
    person who baked bread was called Baker. A person who
    had a very good voice was named Singer.
    It is interesting to know the history of names. Do you know
    how you got your family name?

    What Is a Green Onion?
    Luen is learning English in Canada. One day, he was
    going to the grocery store. His Canadian friend asked him
    to buy some green onions for him. “Sure,” he replied. Easy
    to do. He knew what an onion is -- a round bulb.
    But on the way to the grocery store, Luen wondered,
    “What is a green onion? It must be an onion that is green.”
    When he entered the store, Luen looked at all the onions.
    He didn’t find any that were obviously green. There were
    red, white, purple and even brown onions -- various skin
    colours, but none of them were green.
    “Maybe the colour of the onion is not exactly same as its
    name,” Luen thought. So he peeled some onions to see if
    the colour inside was green. Yes, the white onion had a
    little bit of green underneath. He relaxed. “Okay, I finally
    found green onions.” So he gladly bought the white onion
    and headed home happily.
    When he brought back the “green” onion, his friend was
    puzzled, “Why did you buy a white onion instead of a
    green onion?”
    Luen answered, “Look, the inside of this onion is green.
    This is the closest I was able to find.”
    His friend burst out laughing. Now he understood. He then
    explained that a green onion is a different kind of onion. It
    is a young onion with green shoots. Its white bulb end has
    not fully developed. Mostly people use it for its long green
    stalks. Luen now knew what a green onion was.
    His friend explained that in English, some words are
    formed by two words. We call them compound words.
    Sometimes, the two parts of compound words are joined
    without a space and look like one word. Other times, they
    are not joined.
    Also, they might not have the same meaning as the
    original words. For example, “eggplant” has nothing to do
    with eggs. A “hot dog” is not a dog. It’s a sausage. A
    “sweet potato” is not a potato at all.
    Luen was a little bit embarrassed. But he was happy too.
    That day, he learned a good lesson about English words.

    The Worker
    (adapted from a traditional Middle Eastern tale)
    All over the world, there are those who labour with their
    hands, and there are those who work with their brains.
    The world needs both kinds of workers, and each must be
    respected for what he contributes to the world.
    Sometimes, however, those who are educated and work
    with their brains believe that they are more important than
    the labourers. Such was the case long ago, when a
    professor asked a boatman to bring him safely across a
    river.
    As the labourer worked, the professor struck up a
    conversation. “Do you know about mathematics and
    science?” he asked. “Have you studied philosophy and
    languages?” he continued arrogantly.
    The worker replied simply that he did not see the need to
    have such skills. The professor scoffed at him and said,
    “You have wasted your life, good man. These skills are
    most useful to a man.”
    Time passed, and the boat came to the middle of the river.
    The water was deep there, and the current swift. The boat
    was old and weak, and it sprang a small leak. Water
    slowly began to fill the floor of the boat.
    The boatman looked at the educated man sitting deep in
    thoughts, thinking about mathematics, philosophy and all
    things scholarly. “May I enquire as to whether or not you
    have learned to swim?” asked the humble working man.
    The educated man replied that he had never learned to
    swim. “I am an educated man,” he said. “What need do I
    have to learn such a skill as swimming?”
    The boatman watched the water as it began to come into
    the boat more quickly. “That is too bad, dear educated
    man, for it means that your life has been for nothing. Look
    and see the water coming in. Our boat is sinking, and the
    river is deep and wide.”
    6-23
    Time Machine
    Do you know that there is a way to look into the past right
    in your own house? It’s true.
    It’s called a mirror.
    You see, everything that moves has a speed -- even light.
    Although it travels incredibly fast, light still has a speed,
    and you can measure it.
    When you look into your mirror, you are seeing the light
    that is reflected off your face. It travels to the mirror, then
    back to your eye so you can see it.
    Although that light travels really fast, it still takes time for it
    to get to your mirror, and then back to you.
    The time it takes is unbelievably small. How small? Well
    think about this. Light moves so quickly that it can travel
    around the earth seven times in one second!
    “What has all of this got to do with looking into the past?”
    you might ask. Good question. Here’s the explanation.
    There is a measurement called a light year. The strange
    thing is that it doesn’t measure time. It measures distance
    -- the distance light travels in one year, which is a very
    long distance: 10 trillion kilometres. So if we took your
    mirror and moved it back the distance it takes light to
    travel in one year, how far in the past would we be
    seeing?
    Well, the light has to come from something in the past,
    travel 10 trillion kilometres to the mirror, and then another
    10 trillion kilometres back to you. So the answer is two
    years.
    But there is a problem with using your mirror to see the
    past. The light would have to be as bright as a star for you
    to see it because it must travel 20 trillion kilometres back
    and forth. That would be a very powerful light!
    Isn’t science interesting?

    Left Brain, Right Brain
    Are you good at mathematics? How about writing poems
    or painting beautiful pictures? Do you love to sing, or
    would you rather sit down and work out a complicated
    puzzle? It all depends on whether you are a “right-brain”
    or a “left-brain” person.
    The human brain is a truly amazing organ. It’s not easy to
    study the brain, but science is slowly beginning to
    understand how it works. The brain is divided into two
    equal, but separate parts: the left side and the right side.
    Some people use the left side of the brain more than the
    right. Others use the right side more than the left.
    We can understand a lot about our learning skills based
    on which side of the brain we use most. It’s still a theory,
    but many brain specialists are convinced that most of us
    are either left-brain or right-brain people.
    A small minority of people use the left and right sides of
    the brain equally. Everyone is like this at birth, but we
    gradually begin to use one side of the brain more than the
    other.
    Left-brain people excel in math, science and reading.
    They do well in school. They concentrate easily, and can
    focus on specific tasks. They like to work independently,
    and often enjoy studying alone.
    Right-brain people are more artistic. They love music and
    singing. They like to be around lots of people, and they
    learn best in groups. They don’t like to sit still.
    The fact that you use one side of your brain more doesn’t
    mean that you don’t use the other side. It just means that
    you prefer one side to the other. One way is not better
    than the other. It only indicates the way you learn best.
    Think about your friends. What are they good at in school?
    How do they study? If your best friend loves painting, she
    is probably a right-brain person. If she really shines when
    working out a complicated math problem, chances are that
    she is a left-brain person.
    What about you? Which side of your brain do you think
    you use most often?

    The Basketball Team
    I was always tall for my age. When I started Grade 7, I
    was taller than everyone in the school including all the
    boys and most of the teachers.
    But I was never very athletic. Other kids could do things in
    sports that I just couldn’t do, like hit or throw a baseball. I
    was the world’s worst thrower. The ball would fall out of
    my hand onto the ground about ten feet away. I was
    terrible.
    In Grade 8, we got a new teacher at our school. He took
    one look at me and said, “This school needs a basketball
    team, and you are going to be the star!” I laughed, and my
    friends laughed even more.
    “Darlene doesn’t even know what a basketball is!” joked
    one of my friends. The new coach said, “Don’t worry. I’ll
    show you what she can do.”
    Every day after school, I worked with the new coach. He
    told me that because I was so tall, my job would be to play
    centre. A centre is a player who stands under the net and
    puts rebounds into the net. Centres are always the tallest
    on the team.
    I did push-ups and sit-ups. Most of all, I practiced
    shooting. When I first started, I got zero of ten shots I took.
    But after a few weeks, I had about five of ten shots landing
    in the basket.
    I still wasn’t very good. But I was so tall that if someone
    took a shot I was usually the first one to reach the ball
    after it came down from the net. I became pretty good at
    putting the ball into the net from close range.
    The season came and went. We didn’t do very well, but
    I learned something about myself that season.
    I’m in Grade 9 now and not good enough yet to make it to
    the high school team. But I think I will be next year.
    It’s exciting to discover something about yourself and to
    realize that you are what you make of yourself.

    The Man Who Fought Lions
    (adapted from a Bible story)
    Long ago, in the land of the Middle East, a great man lived
    a good life. He was a judge among his people. Everyone
    liked him very much. At that time, he was the strongest
    man in all the world. He was born to lead his people --
    wisely and with justice. This man’s name was Samson.
    In this land, there lived another nation of people. This
    nation did not fear anything. They were always at war and
    always threatening the people of Samson. One day,
    Samson was on his way to visit this dangerous nation. Out
    of the woods came a fierce lion, roaring and threatening to
    kill the good judge. Samson was not afraid. He fought the
    lion with all his strength and killed the animal.
    Soon, Samson met a beautiful woman named Delilah. He
    fell in love with her and began to court her. The leaders of
    the evil nation promised Delilah a lot of money if she could
    discover the secret of Samson’s great strength. As
    Samson loved and trusted this woman, he finally revealed
    the secret of his strength. “Look at my long hair,” he said.
    “It has never been cut, and that is why I am so strong. If
    my hair is cut, I will lose my great power.”
    Delilah wanted the money she had been promised, so she
    had a servant cut off Samson’s hair while he slept. When
    he awoke, Samson discovered that his power was lost.
    The soldiers of the bad nation captured him and put him in
    prison. They cut out his eyes and made him their servant.
    But they were in for a surprise because, as you know, hair
    grows back after it has been cut. Over many months,
    Samson’s hair grew long again, and his strength returned.
    One day, his captors decided to have some fun. They
    ordered Samson to come to a building where they were all
    gathered. They wanted to make fun of the man who was
    once the strongest in all the world.
    Samson asked the boy who was leading him there to let
    him touch the pillars that held up the building. Samson
    then took hold of the pillars and pulled them down.
    The building fell and killed everyone, including the
    strongest man.

    Don’t Judge a Book by Its Cover
    Walk downtown in most large cities and you’ll see many
    homeless people. They live on the street and often beg for
    money. Their clothes are dirty, and sometimes they’re wild
    and scary.
    When I walk in this part of a city, I avoid any contact with
    these people. I don’t look them in the eyes. If they were
    normal people, they would get off the streets, clean
    themselves up and get a job, right?
    Well, I learned a valuable lesson about homeless people
    today. I saw a story on the TV news that made me change
    the way I think about them.
    The story was about a 44-year-old homeless man who
    had been living on the streets in Winnipeg for more than
    seven years. His favourite hangout was along the banks of
    the Red River. The water runs fast in this river, and the ice
    had recently broken up, so it was cold and dangerous.
    A young boy lost his footing and fell into the cold and
    treacherous water. There were many people around. They
    called for help, but no one was willing to jump in the water.
    But when the homeless man saw the boy, he didn’t
    hesitate. He immediately jumped in and brought the boy
    safely back to shore.
    Everyone was amazed by this dirty, unkempt man. The
    mayor of the city came to speak with him, and later gave
    him the keys to the city. People brought him food and
    clothes and offered him shelter. Everyone said he was a
    hero. No one else had the courage to jump in to save the
    boy, but this homeless man was different.
    When the television reporter asked him why he did it, he
    said he didn’t think about it. He just jumped in to help. It
    was simple to him. “When a fellow human needs help, you
    help,” he said.
    When they asked him what gift they could give to him, his
    reply hit me really hard. He said, “My father lives way up
    north. I would be happy if you could help me travel there
    to see him one final time.”
    What was my valuable lesson? Don’t judge a book by its
    cover.

    A Story of Hope
    On May 12, 2008, a class of chemistry students in a rural
    Chinese province was sitting and attentively listening to
    their teacher. The ground suddenly began to shake. It was
    an earthquake. In a few seconds, the building collapsed,
    killing many under the rubble.
    For one student named Xue Xiao, this was the beginning
    of an 80-hour nightmare. Lying alone in the dark, he kept
    his spirits up by telling himself over and over that
    someone would rescue him. Imagine the fear as this
    young boy lay alone under his fallen school. Some would
    have given up, but not Xue. He was determined to survive.
    The next day, he heard people digging. He called out to
    them. The rescuers worked for two days to save this boy.
    They promised him that he would get out, and he fully
    believed them. He did not give up hope. He wanted to see
    his parents again. He wanted to live.
    A funny thing happened when the rescuers finally reached
    him. As they pulled him out from the rubble, he shouted,
    “Give me a cola!” He was rushed to a nearby hospital, but
    his ordeal was not over yet.
    At the hospital, the doctors told him they would have to cut
    off his right arm. It had been crushed and needed to be
    amputated for him to survive. He agreed, and the
    operation to save his life began.
    Xue’s story was broadcast across the nation. People
    heard of his bravery. They heard how he had wanted a
    cola upon his rescue. Many showed up at the hospital with
    colas for him.
    The young boy’s story was one of hope amid all the
    destruction of the earthquake. People were amazed by his
    optimistic spirit.
    He still has a long road ahead of him until he is fully
    recovered. However, he continues to be happy and to look
    forward to the future. He told reporters that he wants to be
    a scientist when he grows up. He said he will learn how to
    do everything using only one arm.
    In a moment of disaster, this young boy showed that there
    is always room for hope.

    Li-Ann’s Surprise
    A girl in our class named Li-Ann got sick a while ago. We
    were all very worried about her. The doctors said she
    would be fine. The only problem was that the treatment
    she was going to receive would cause all of her hair to fall
    out for a while. But it would come back.
    Li-Ann was very upset about this. But what could she do?
    The treatment would make her well again, so she really
    had no choice. Can you imagine how you would feel if you
    lost all your hair? It would be embarrassing, especially for
    a pretty girl like Li-Ann.
    Li-Ann had her treatment, and she got better. Just as the
    doctors had advised her, all her hair fell out. She was
    completely bald! After a few weeks, her parents tried to
    get her to go to school, but she wouldn’t. She could not
    get the courage to return to school with her bald head.
    One day, after our teacher told us about how Li-Ann felt
    about coming to school without her hair, our class talked
    about it for a while and came up with a great idea. “Let’s
    all cut off our hair,” said one student. “Yes. Great idea,”
    said another. “We’ll shave our heads, and then Li-Ann will
    not feel all alone.”
    We all shaved our heads bald the next day at school. We
    felt really good about what we were doing for our friend.
    Then, our teacher went to Li-Ann’s house and convinced
    her to go to school the next day. She agreed because it
    would be a Saturday, and there would be no one there.
    The next morning, Li-Ann went to school wearing a hat.
    She walked down the empty hall to her classroom, where
    she thought she was meeting only the teacher. Li-Ann
    opened the door and -- “SURPRISE!” The whole class
    was there. She started to cry because she was so happy.
    Everyone looked just like her now. We were all bald. She
    could hardly believe what her friends had done.

    Nature’s Golden Root
    My aunt and uncle are really amazing people. They’re a
    little different from most of us. Uncle Al has a university
    education in agriculture. Aunt Helen received her degree
    in natural science. You might have guessed that they both
    love nature.
    One day, Uncle Al said that life is short. He wanted to live
    the remainder of his days doing something that truly
    satisfied him. Aunt Helen agreed. They quit their jobs at
    the university and bought a small property in the
    countryside.
    However, they still needed to make a living. How could
    they live well and still earn enough to survive? Well, they
    both knew that ginseng grows wild all over the eastern
    part of Canada. They also knew that there is a big market
    for ginseng around the world. They decided to spend their
    days searching for and harvesting wild ginseng. What a
    good way to live their dream!
    They learned that ginseng grows in hardwood forests. It’s
    not easy to find, but once you know what it looks like, you
    simply go out into the forest and harvest it. Don’t get me
    wrong, it’s still a lot of hard work. You have to deal with
    biting insects and a lot of walking in hot weather. “But
    when you find a patch of wild ginseng, it makes you feel
    like a king,” says Uncle Al.
    Buyers from around the world pay good money for
    Canada’s wild ginseng. The size and shape of the root is
    really important. A root sells for $30 on average. But wait
    until you hear this! At a sale two years ago, a buyer paid
    $10,000 for a single root. That’s a lot of money!
    My aunt and uncle have never found a root that brought
    them that much money, but they continue to search for
    one. In the meantime, they go out most days in the fall to
    hunt for ginseng. They don’t make a lot of money, but they
    do make enough to live well.
    Ginseng is a wonderful herb. It helps many people with
    health problems, and it helps my aunt and uncle live their
    dream. “One day, I’m going to hit the jackpot,” Uncle Al
    says. “Imagine the day when I find a ginseng root that
    sells for $10,000!”
    Wild ginseng is truly “nature’s gold”
